He probably joined the Cologne painters'guildbefore leaving for Italy around 1574.After a stay in Venice, von Aachen was soon in Rome, learning from a circle of Northern European artists. He also painted portraits in Florence. Back in Germany by 1587, he began to gain fame for history pictures and psychologically sensitive portraits.In 1592 Emperor Rudolf II of Prague named Von Aachen imperial painterin absentia. Four years later he moved to Prague, serving as painter, art dealer, and diplomat while also completing commissions for clients in Munich and Augsburg. He frequently journeyed abroad on diplomatic missions and to purchase pictures for his insatiable patron. After Rudolf's death in 1612, von Aachen worked for his successor, Emperor Matthias.Von Aachen's Prague paintings reflect Rudolf's desire for sensuality, with smoothly modeled, elongated figures arranged in elegant poses, often including a nude woman seen from behind. His style combined an idealization indebted to Roman and Florentine Mannerism with brilliant Venetian color and Dutch realism. The many engravings published after his designs spread von Aachen's influence." .

She learned photography in the 1920s in Paris, as a studio assistant of fellow American expatriate Man Ray. She soon opened her own portrait studio, where she photographed artists and intellectuals living in Paris, including James Joyce and Eugène Atget. After Atget's death, Abbott was instrumental in promoting his work by preserving his prints and negatives and arranging for publications and exhibitions of his photographs. She returned to the United States and began to photograph the architectural landscape of New York City, which resulted in the publicationChanging New York. She taught at the New School for Social Research in New York from the 1930s until 1958." .

His vision is inspired by his joy in nature's inherent beauty, yet tempered by his dismay at its exploitation and degradation. Adams uses photography to express his love for the landscape and to understand how urban and industrial growth have changed it, all the while insisting that beauty in the world has not been entirely eclipsed.Adams was born in New Jersey in 1937 and raised in the suburbs of Denver, Colorado. He moved to Southern California in 1956 to attend the University of Redlands. He chose to major in English literature and went on to earn a Ph.D. in that subject at the University of Southern California in 1965.When Adams returned to Colorado to begin what he anticipated would be a career in teaching, he was dismayed by the changes he saw in the landscape. He bought a 35-mm camera, taught himself the fundamentals of photography, and began making pictures infused with a love for the geography of his home state.Adams's visual education came in part through the work of photographers who had preceded him in the West a century before, especially those of Timothy O'Sullivan, William Henry Jackson, and Carleton Watkins. Their work, together with that of Lewis Hine, Edward Weston, Dorothea Lange, and Ansel Adams--who often merged their social concerns with aesthetic ones--helped inspire Adams's style: a spare formalism coupled with emotional depth.Since the 1970s, more than twenty-five books of Adams's photographs have been published, as well as two collections of essays,Beauty in Photography: Essays in Defense of Traditional Values(1989) andWhy People Photograph(1994)." .

Unlike Henry Moore or Barbara Hepworth, whose work always related to the human figure or natural landscape, Adams freed his forms from the world around him and explored the pure interplay of angular and circular objects in space.In the 1930s and early 1940s, Adams supported himself with a variety of jobs and was only able to study art intermittently. But after World War II, during which he served as an engineer, he was able to commit to a career as a sculptor. At the age of thirty in 1947, Adams held his first one-man show. Under the influence of Henry Moore, he showed wood, plaster, and stone forms abstracted from the natural world. Trips to Europe and America over the next few years exposed Adams to a range of influences and he broke away from his English contemporaries to create increasingly abstract forms. In Paris, Adams befriended Constantin Brancusi and studied work by Pablo Picasso and Kazimir Malevich. In New York, Adams met a number of American artists including Alexander Calder.Much of Adams' early work was carved wood or stone. But in the mid-1950s, after learning to weld, he increasingly turned to iron, bronze, and, for large architectural reliefs, poured concrete. During the 1960s, he worked primarily with welded steel sheets. Sometimes these forms were pierced allowing light to shine through. Now one of Britain's preeminent abstract sculptors, Adams received commissions for large works across Europe and America. He suddenly abandoned welded steel at the end of the 1960s and returned to carving. Many of his later sculptures are modest bronzes from carved wood patterns, although he did continue to create some large pieces in stainless steel." .

The Society was an eclectic group of intellectuals with a wide variety of interests; at its meetings, Adamson learned of the invention of photography from Sir David Brewster. Brewster, the newly appointed principal of the St. Andrews colleges, had learned about photography through correspondence with one of its inventors, William Henry Fox Talbot. Some of the first photographs made in England were exhibited at the Society's meetings.Adamson primarily made portraits and views of the countryside near his home; he was known fornaturalistic, lively renderings of his subjects. He also taught photography to his brother, Robert Adamson. Many of John Adamson's prints survive in the Getty Museum's Brewster Album, in which Brewster assembled early photographs made in England and Scotland between 1839 and 1850." .

His surviving vases suggest that he specialized in the decoration of large vessels. His work marks the transition from theArchaicto theClassicalstyle in Greek vase-painting. The Aegisthus Painter's fondness for crowded, multi-figured scenes carried over from the Archaic period, yet aspects of his drawing style, like the nose that forms a straight line with the forehead and the heavy chins, were characteristic of the new Classical style. As with most ancient artists, the real name of the Aegisthus Painter is unknown, and he is identified only by the stylistic traits of his work. Scholars named him after the scene of the death of Aegisthus on a vase in a museum in Bologna, Italy." .

The Affecter may have learned his trade from the Amasis Painter, one of the leading artists of the preceding generation, but he quickly diverged from the conventional path in both his potting and painting. The Affecter's potting was technically excellent. Most of his surviving vases are amphorae, but he chose unusual, old-fashioned forms and then added variations. At a time when Athenian vase-painters stressed thenarrativecontent of their work, the Affecter appeared uninterested and focused on the purely decorative aspects. In fact, he may not have been working to suit Athenian taste.

He appears to have learned his craft from one of the leading painters of the preceding generation, Douris. Although the Akestorides Painter's surviving works include several vase shapes, he specialized in decorating cups. His work focused on scenes from daily life, especially athletics, school scenes, andsymposiaor drinking parties.As with most ancient artists, the real name of the Akestorides Painter is unknown, and he is identified only by the stylistic traits of his work. Scholars named him after the kalos inscription praising the beautiful youth Akestorides that appears on several of his vases." .

The count recognized the growing taste for a French style in the decorative arts and hired artisans from the renowned Moustiers Manufactories in southern France. Many early Alcora designs were based on the work of French artists, including Jacques Callot and Jean Bérain.Alcora specialized intin-glazedearthenware (faience) and produced tableware, plaques,medallions, figures, and portraitbusts. Supported and protected by the Bourbon monarchy, Alcora expanded rapidly and its ceramics were exported to France, Italy, Portugal, and the Americas. When the count died in 1742, the factory was passed to his son, Pedro Pablo, Ximénez de Urrea, Abarca de Boléa. Under Pedro Pablo's leadership, the factory produced exuberant and colorfulRococovessels and began making creamware (made of pipe clay) andsoft-paste porcelain. Alcora flourished well into the 1800s, but as interest in Rococo styles waned, so did the factory's fortunes." .

Most of his career however, was devoted to making engravings of mythological and Biblical subjects such as theTwelve Labors ofHerculesand the Story of Adam and Eve.Stylistically Aldegrever's work reflects the influence of Albrecht Dürer, whose work was widely known throughout Europe and whose monogram Aldegrever imitated. Unlike Dürer and his followers who specialized in intricate line work, Aldegrever specialized in optical effects of light and shadow. Slim, elongated figures and agitated drapery further distinguish his work. Aldegrever produced almost 300 engravings between 1527 and 1555, nearly all on a miraculously small scale." .

Exposure to the classically tempered realism of the Carracci school underpinned Algardi's style, which embodied both classicism and the High Baroque.After carving ivory and modeling figures and ornaments for Duke Ferdinando Gonzaga in Mantua, Algardi settled in Rome by 1625. For ten years, he restored ancient sculpture while becoming known for portrait busts that captured both inward character and details of appearance. In Rome, his constant interaction with ancient classical statuary influenced his own sculpture.Unlike most contemporary sculptors, Algardi was an accomplished draftsman and also worked as an architect. Association with artists such as Domenichino, Nicolas Poussin, and Pietro da Cortona greatly affected his draftsmanship. His surviving drawings primarily relate to his sculptural projects or designs for engravings.Algardi received his first major sculptural commission at age forty, the tomb of Pope Leo XI. His large, influential workshop included Domenico Guidi, Ercole Ferrata, Michel Anguier, and Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi. Copies of Algardi's sculptures spread throughout Europe, inspiring such artists as Edmé Bouchardon." .

His father, a sword maker, died when Allori was five, and the painter Agnolo Bronzino was made guardian of the family. Allori incorporated Bronzino's name into his own, as seen in the inscription on one of his paintings:Alexander Alorius Angeli Bronzini Alumnus Faciebat A D MDLXX(Allessandro Allori, foster-son of Agnolo Bronzino, made [this] in the year 1552).After a short sojourn in Rome, where he was influenced by Michelangelo's art, Allori returned to his native Florence. There he became one of the principal painters for the ruling family of Florence, theMedici. Allori was appointed director of the Florentine tapestry factory in the mid-1570s. His work, which displays the complicated twisting poses typical of FlorentineMannerism, influenced artistic developments in Tuscany for almost fifty years following his death." .

He joined the paintersguildthere in 1599, around the same time that he was named official painter toArchduke Albertand Archduchess Isabella, for whom he created landscape paintings, images of court festivities, and designs for at least one set of tapestries. Alsloot's most famous and lucrative commission was a series of paintings recording theOmmegang, a splendid court procession through Brussels in 1615, during which Isabella was made Queen of the Crossbowmen's Guild.Alsloot's surviving works are rare: some thirty paintings and a few drawings. In his landscapes, Alsloot drew inspiration from the forest of Soignes near Brussels. Landscape painting of the late 1500s and the wooded landscapes of Gillis van Coninxloo also influenced his work. Alsloot's own style displayed a refined handling of foliage with a tendency to include views of castles andabbeysfrom the forest of Soignes. His paintings are usually topographically accurate, making it possible to identify places that survive today. The artist Hendrick de Clerck regularly added brightly colored figures, which often clash with the landscapes' brown-green tonality, to Alsloot's paintings,." .

With this success, he acquired three homes and several vineyards. He also worked for suchpatronsas Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and Duke William of Bavaria. Chosen Regensburg's mayor in 1528, Altdorfer declined because he needed time to complete a gigantic painting for the duke.Altdorfer's formats ranged from postage-stamp-sized etchings to life-sized paintings. In addition to prints and paintings, he made colored-groundchiaroscurodrawings and designed stained-glass windows. Fantasy, brilliant colors, and dazzling light effects at sunset or dawn marked his paintings, which usually depicted landscape.The first landscape painter in the modern sense and the leading figure of the Danube School, Altdorfer introduced landscape as a theme of its own in art. Unlike most of his German contemporaries, he painted few portraits, preferring to focus on the virgin forest or to use it as a setting for both secular and religious subjects. With their gestures, facial expressions, and color distorted for dramatic and emotional ends, his figures complemented his landscapes, themselves alive with an unusual sense of character." .

He may have apprenticed in Basel or Zurich and probably also studied in Paris and Lyon.In 1561 Amman settled in Nuremberg, where he worked with Virgil Solis. After Solis's death in 1562, Amman began a lifelong partnership with Solis's publisher, adapting himself to every task and changing his style according to his employer's demands. The era's most prolific book illustrator, Amman illustrated at least fifty books for him alone. These projects included biblicalcompositions, widely reprinted scenes of tradespeople, and an artists' instruction book; many served as pattern books for later artists. He also made ornamental designs and etchings, including over a hundred portraits for an aristocratic Nuremberg family. A pupil said that Amman's drawings from one four-year period would have filled a hay wagon.By 1581 Amman was famous. He painted theElectorLudwig VI on his deathbed in Heidelberg, designed the Würzburg University church portal, and taught drawing to an English earl. He also designed stained glass and jewelry. Still he lived in constant poverty. Shortly before his death, knowing that estate taxes would bankrupt his family, he plead with rich relatives in Zurich for help." .

Except for a visit to Rome around 1511, where his style gained greater monumentality, and a year-long stay in France in 1518, where he completed a few works at the invitation ofFrançois I, he spent most of his life in Florence.Patronsadmired Andrea's fluent elaboration of the HighRenaissancestyle and the natural expression of emotion in his mainly religious works. He used patches of colored light and shade to shape forms, rather than conceiving painting as colored drawing.In the early 1510s, Jacopo Pontormo, Rosso Fiorentino, and Giorgio Vasari, (who later maliciously slandered Andrea for lacking creative fire) trained in Andrea's highly influential studio. His process of making a series of preparatory drawings before painting demonstrated his patient pursuit of perfection and became a pattern for later artists.In 1517 or 1518 he married a wealthy widow who had modeled for him for several years, both for portraits and for Madonnas. In the 1520s, he built a substantial house in Florence, and his style became more ideal and more polished." .

There he became the director of an activemaiolicaworkshop. Because of his great skill in the difficultlustertechnique, Andreoli was frequently hired to embellish the wares of other workshops, an unusual practice. After adorning these works of other masters, he often signed the pieces himself. So famous did he become that the Duke of Urbino granted him citizenship and exempted him from paying taxes and duties. In 1519, the pope himself renewed Andreoli's exemptions \"in consideration of the honor which redounds to the city...and in consideration of [his wares'] great usefulness and profitableness in revenue.\"" .

When the academy refused to deviate from their policy of only male nude models, he and his father established a private college in their home where artists could study the female figure.Between 1805 and 1808, Andriessen executed his most important work, a diary that chronicled the artistic and social life of the period. Among the seven hundred drawings and watercolors in the diary are street scenes, theatrical and musical performances, and studio scenes. No known paintings by Andriessen exist, and scholars believe that he derived his primary source of income from his activity as a drawing instructor for young girls of good society." .

After some training in Normandy, the fifteen-year-old Michel followed François to Paris, where they worked in a sculptor's workshop. Thirteen years later, they went to Rome. François left after two years, but Michel stayed eight more, studying ancient sculpture and authors and absorbing aclassicismthat remained with him for life. He studied with Alessandro Algardi, whose moderate,classicizingBaroquestyle served the Anguiers better in France than Gianlorenzo Bernini's extreme Italian Baroque.The brothers revealed their new Roman influence in the Montmorency tomb in Moulins, where they worked together from 1649 to 1652. After that point their careers diverged. Michel became a favorite of the queen mother, Anne of Austria, whose apartments in theLouvrehe decorated. He was the major provider of outdoor sculpture atNicolas Fouquet'schâteau and park ofVaux-le-Vicomte, south of Paris; spent five years working on aNativitysculpture for the Parisian church of Val-de-Grâce; and created severely classicalreliefsfor the triumphal arch of the Porte Saint-Denis. Teaching at theAcadémie Royaledominated Michel's life in the 1670s, and his lectures there were renowned." .

One of the artists working for these rulers developed a version of theInternational styleinfluenced by French andBohemianart and characterized by sweet and graceful figures, a lightpastelpalette, and delicate, often realistic drawing. A number of artists, including Anovelo da Imbonate, worked alongside this master, using personal variations of his style." .

Early on, however, Antico became well known as a sculptor. Like many fifteenth-century sculptors, he trained as a goldsmith; his use of silver for contrast in his later bronzes reflects thisbackground. His earliest surviving works are medals made in 1479 on the occasion of the marriage of Antonia del Balzo and Count Gianfrancesco Gonzaga, the ruler of Mantua. These are signed with his pseudonymAntico,indicating that he was already known for his signatureantiquestyle.For his entire career, Antico worked in the thriving artistic court ofRenaissanceMantua, which clearly appreciated his antique-style sculptures. As was typical forcourt artists, Antico lived at Gianfrancesco's palace at Bozzolo beginning in the 1480s. There he also made bronzereductionsof Roman antiquities for Gianfrancesco's young brother,BishopLudovico Gonzaga. In the early 1500s Antico began working forIsabella d'Este, wife of Francesco II Gonzaga. After 1506 Antico replaced Andrea Mantegna as Isabella's artistic advisor in her purchases of antiquities. Later in his life, Antico turned towards architecture." .

Working in a period when many artists were switching to the newred-figure technique, the Antimenes Painter was one of the most prolific black-figure artists of his time. Over 140 of his vases survive, mostly amphorae andhydriai. He decorated his vases with a wide range of mythological andgenrescenes but seems to have favored two themes: the heroHeraklesand fountain-house scenes.As with most ancient artists, the true name of the Antimenes Painter is unknown; he is identified only by the stylistic traits of his work. Scholars named him after a kalos inscription praising the youth Antimenes on a vase now in the Rijksmuseum in Leiden." .

He signed his name to two cups, and many more have been attributed to him on the basis of style. He worked in thered-figure technique; like many vase-painters, he tended to specialize in the decoration of cups.The process of identifying the work of Apollodoros shows the difficulties in recognizing the work of ancient artists. In the early 1900s, scholars distinguished four stylistically distinct but closely related groups of vases, assigning them the names Apollodoros, the Epidromos Painter, the Kleomelos Painter, and the Elpinikos Painter. Scholars were unsure, however, whether these four groups actually represented the work of four separate individuals or four different stages in the career of one man. The cup depicting the ThebanSphinxin the Getty Museum now provides evidence that one individual made all these vases. This cup combines a kalos inscription praising the beautiful youth Kleomelos--which had been the defining feature of the \"Kleomelos Painter\"--with stylistic features found on the signed cups of Apollodoros, such as mannered proportions and pose, extremely slender elongated fingers, and small, deep-set eyes." .

This complete inscription, \"Aristodamos of Argos made it,\" has helped scholars identify other works by the artist. Before the discovery of this inscription, scholars had assumed that the nameAristodamosappearing alone on several shield straps found at the Sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia was meant to label one of the figures depicted on these bands. The Getty Museum's piece makes it clear that these are abbreviated signatures of a maker.The city of Argos in southern Greece was a center for bronze working in theArchaicperiod, producing armor as well as sculpture. For an artist to sign his work in this medium and at this time is quite unusual. Aristodamos is one of the first Greek artists known to sign his work, indicating a new awareness and pride in his craft." .

Aspertini was a gifted prodigy whosefrescoes, facade decorations, andaltarpiecesdisplay a complex, eclectic style anticipatingMannerism. Born into a family of painters, Aspertini studied under many Bolognese masters, including Francesco Francia, who practiced a gentle, graceful manner derived from Raphael. A passionate scholar ofantiquity, Aspertini often incorporatedmotifsdrawn from ancient art and architecture in his painting and drawings. Begun during his stay in Rome from 1500 to 1503, Aspertini's sketchbooks of drawings afterclassicalruins are important records of contemporary knowledge of ancient art.After returning to Bologna in 1504, Aspertini soon joined Francia and others in painting frescoes for the newly restored oratory of Santa Cecila in San Giacomo Maggiore. From 1510 to 1530, although continuing painting commissions, Aspertini primarily devoted himself to sculpture, creating part of San Petronio's facade. The highly respected Aspertini was one of two artists chosen to decorate a triumphal arch forPope Clement VIIandEmperor Charles V'sentry into Bologna in 1529." .

Named for his uncle, a successful sculptor, Tiziano was born in the Italian city of Padua in 1565 to a famous family of founders. He learned his skillful bronze casting technique in the family business and then studied sculpture with Girolamo Campagna, the most prominent sculptor in Venice between 1580 and 1600. With Campagna and then on his own, Tiziano contributed to large-scale public commissions in Venice, Padua, and Tuscany.For most of his life, however, Tiziano worked for one person, Giovanni Grimani, a distinguished church official known for his collection of antiquities and his patronage of artists. Tiziano restored Grimani's ancient statues and made many pieces for his patron's home. At the end of his life, Tiziano moved to Pisa to live in the household of Grimani's great-nephew. Living near the famous marble quarries of Massa-Carrara, Tiziano branched out from the bronze work in which he had made his reputation and worked as a stone sculptor until his death in 1606." .

Although he had probably already studied painting at theAcadémie Royalein Paris before starting at Sèvres, he was first ordered to paint cherubs, pastoral scenes, and flower sprays like other apprentices. After several years of work, he graduated to painting military scenes,allegories, and, during theFrench Revolution, republican images.Asselin also painted scenes in oils orgouacheand was given the task of producing four overdoor paintings for thegrandsalonof the manufactory. He also probably wrote an instruction manual for painting flowers, which was dedicated to the wife of the British Ambassador. Asselin eventually became head of the painters' workshop." .

In 1849 that photograph earned a gold medal in a local competition at the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers (Conservatory of Arts and Letters), located a few blocks south of the Atelier's address at 13 boulevard St.-Martin in Paris. In the 1840s a good deal of direct sunlight was needed to make the exposures for photographs, so studios were usually located on the roofs of buildings. The Atelier Héliographique was located on the ground floor; therefore, it was probably not a photographic studio but a business that distributed and sold photographs, specializing in daguerreotype portraits." .

Instead of traditional letterpress printing, the book's handwritten text and illustrations were created by the cyanotype method. Atkins printed and published Part I ofBritish Algaein 1843 and in doing so established photography as an accurate medium for scientific illustration.Atkins learned directly about the invention of photography through her correspondence with its inventor, William Henry Fox Talbot. Although she owned a camera, she used only the cameralessphotogenic drawingtechnique to produce all of her botanical images. With the assistance of Anne Dixon, Atkins created albums of cyanotype photogenic drawings of her botanical specimens. She learned the cyanotype printing method through its inventor, the astronomer and scientist Sir John Herschel, a family friend." .

In 1776 an English silversmith described Auguste in a letter: \"as I have not seen the best productions of Monsr Auguste I therefore presume I have seen nothing. His fame I am persweded is founded on superior Merit because I have heard so many Noblemen of good Tast concur in ye same opinion of him....\"As a young man, Auguste worked with several different goldsmiths but was never officially apprenticed. A special court order freed him from thisguildnecessity because he produced work for the king. He was one of the first Parisian goldsmiths to execute pieces in theNeoclassicalstyle. Hispatronsincluded royalty and aristocracy, both in France and abroad. Auguste was the favorite goldsmith ofLouis XVI, king of France, and carried out many commissions for the court, including the crown used at Louis' coronation.Madame de Pompadour, Catherine II of Russia, and the Count de Creutz, the Swedish Ambassador to the French court, were among Auguste's other prominent customers." .

After his mother remarried a captain in the Dutch guards, the family left France for Amsterdam. Aved's exposure to Dutch art led to his development of the \"psychological portrait.\" This innovation signaled a shift away from the mythologizing style of contemporaries like Nicolas de Largillière.By the age of sixteen, Aved was traveling through the Netherlands drawing portraits at fairs. After short stints in the Amsterdam studios of French artists, he arrived in Paris at nineteen. Working in a fashionable portrait painter's studio, Aved met Maurice-Quentin de La Tour, Jean-Baptiste Perroneau, and Jean-Étienne Liotard. Most important, he began a long, cherished friendship with Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin. Together they shared the goal of capturing \"truth\" rather than depicting surface appearances alone. Many of Aved's portraits were attributed to Chardin during the 1800s.As a Parisian, Aved became a successful and independent artist, a member of theAcadémiede Peinture, and one of the foremost connoisseurs of his day. He owned a large, important collection that included paintings by or attributed to Rembrandt van Rijn, Gerrit Dou, Nicolaes Berchem, Anthony van Dyck, Domenichino, Tintoretto, Guercino, Claude Lorrain, Nicolas Poussin, and others, along with an extensive collection of Rembrandt etchings." .

Avercamp was a deaf-mute from birth, and was commonly known by his nickname, \"de Stomme\" or \"de Stom,\" translated as \"the mute\" in Dutch. It is generally assumed that he was a pupil of the history and portrait painter Pieter Isaacks, in whose house in Amsterdam he is thought to have lived in 1607. His style is distinctly linked to Flemish landscape painters such as Hans Bol, Gillis van Coninxloo, and David Vinckboons, who had fled to Amsterdam when Antwerp was invaded for a second time by the Spanish in 1585.Avercamp specialized in, and indeed virtually established the Dutch genre of animated and colorful winter scenes with people disporting on the ice. His imagery reflects the flush of creativity, optimism, and sense of Dutch identity issuing from Holland's achievement of independence from Spain during the early seventeenth century, which gave rise to the Golden Age of Dutch art and culture." .

As he produced chairs, stools, and settees for upholsterers and dealers, he probably never earned much money. His business was so poor that he was forced to declare bankruptcy twice, in 1769 and in 1776. Despite this, Paris archives show that he paid a large sum of money to receive the honorary title of  \"Flag Holder in the Town Hall Guards.\"Avisse's elaborately carved chairs are finely detailed, with creative variations on commonmotifssuch as shells, flowers, and leaves. He used the stampIAVISSEto mark his works." .

Babbitt, adaguerreotypistwho controlled the lucrative pavilion area in front of Point View, later Prospect Point, on the American side of Niagara Falls, was renowned for his tenacious hold on this prime concession. When confronted by a formidable contender, \"Mr. Babbitt and his forces would stand between the camera and the falls swinging large-sized umbrellas to and fro thus preventing [the other photographer] from getting a picture,\" wrote an observer.Another contemporary hailed his images as \"some of the most beautiful views of the falls, and points of interest in this vicinity, that we have seen. As he resides here he has been on hand to take winter views never taken by any other artist. Mountains of ice, huge icicles, trees borne down with their icy burden, the foaming torrent, all and much more are presented with the exactness of reality.\" A colorful figure in the region's history, Babbitt photographed from the 1850s until the early 1870s." .

Bacchiacca borrowed from numerous sources, including the work of northern artists such as Albrecht Dürer, theclassicizingengravings by his contemporary Marcantonio Raimondi, and theManneristpaintings of his onetime collaborator Jacopo Pontormo. Bacchiacca is best known for his small panel paintings with unusual combinations of color. In 1523 he worked with Pontormo on painted bedroom decorations, an influential collaboration which led to Bacchiacca's emphasis on crowded surfaces and the ambiguous, subjective space characteristic of Mannerism. By the early 1540s Bacchiacca returned to more conventionalclassicismbased on Michelangelo's models. Later on, he provided designs for tapestries. By this time the second generation of Mannerists--Agnolo Bronzino, Giorgio Vasari, and Francesco Salviati--had become rich sources ofmotifsfor Bacchiacca's art." .

Early contact in Genoa, Italy, with works by Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck influenced Baciccio deeply, as did Genoese painter Bernardo Strozzi's broad,painterlymanner and warmpalette. After the plague killed his family in 1657, Baciccio moved to Rome, eventually becoming Gianlorenzo Bernini's protégé. Seeing Correggio's works in Parma in 1669 gave Baciccio's decorations a heightenedillusionismand his easel pictures more tenderness.Baciccio's most celebrated work is the ceiling in the church of Il Gesù in Rome, created from 1672 to 1683, whose conception owes much to his collaborator Bernini. In a dramatic innovation, Baciccio organized the ceiling's space by juxtaposing dark and light areas rather than by merely arranging the figures, and he merged painted figures with stucco ones joyously bursting from the frame.Baciccio also paintedaltarpiecesand mythological scenes. His portraits were so renowned that he was commissioned to paint seven popes. His many surviving drawings are all studies for paintings." .

Following that pattern, Jacob Adriaensz. Backer studied with Rembrandt for a short time after years of training in Leeuwarden, Holland, and in no time, he was successful. By 1633 the Amsterdam Orphan Home had commissioned a group portrait from him, and he painted three more large groups during his short career. Though he also painted mythological andallegoricalworks, Backer became known as a portrait specialist. Backer's style is characterized by quiet restraint, smooth, thin paint, and ornamental brushwork. His lighting can be more diffused than Rembrandt's focused, expressiveillumination. During the 1640s Backer fell under the spell of Bartholomeus van der Helst's fashionably pale, cool tonality, but the warmth of Backer'spaletteduring the last decade of his life indicates that he continued to study Rembrandt's works. Backer was one of Amsterdam's most famous painters. A 1649 print portraying Backer bears the inscription, \"excellent painter in the large . . . who knows very well how to make a good nude.\" When he died in his early forties, a commemorative medal was struck in his honor." .

Certainly in Bologna by 1503, Bagnacavallo showed a graceful manner and elongated figures in his early paintings. Raphael's influence dominated Bagnacavallo's mature career, but scholars are uncertain whether they ever met. According to Giorgio Vasari, Bagnacavallo traveled to Rome at some point while Raphael was there, between 1508 and 1520. One of Raphael'saltarpieces, with its clear geometry and sensuous presence, arrived in Bologna around 1514 and served as a strong, continuing reminder of modernclassicismfor local artists. Bagnacavallo and his peers also acquired information about this innovative style from the prints of fellow Bolognese artist Marcantonio Raimondi. Bagnacavallo's Raphaelesque paintings strongly influenced the early style of Pellegrino Tibaldi." .

Like his father Gaspard and elder siblings François and Marie, Nicolas concentrated on the engraving of letters and inscriptions. Only a small number of artists in the eighteenth century specialized in this type of engraving. The maps he produced for the bookNouveau voyage en France(The New Voyage in France) are among his few pictorial engravings." .

He joined the British Army around 1742, served until 1761, and reached the rank of captain. In 1753 he made his earliest dated print, a portrait. Not surprisingly, he also made drawings and engravings of military costumes.Many of Baillie's prints and drawings reproduce seventeenth-century Dutch paintings or drawings in his own or aristocratic collections. He also specialized in prints after Rembrandt van Rijn's etchings and drawings. He owned three plates from which Rembrandt himself had made prints, including that of the renownedHundred Guilder Print.Baillie himself reworked that plate in 1775. He also etched a reversed copy of Rembrandt'sThree Trees,with his own modifications.From 1762 Baillie exhibited at the Society of Artists, England's first public exhibition venue. His collected prints were published in eight editions between 1776 and 1824." .

He worked for a short time as a journeyman in Hamburg before traveling to Venice and Rome at the age of twenty-five. On his return voyage, Bailly probably worked for several German princes. Back in the Netherlands in 1613, he established himself as a painter of vanitas still lifes and portraits. He executed many small-scale drawings of fellow artists and students and professors at the University of Leiden.In his painted portraits, Bailly depicted attractive and expressive subjects in lively domestic settings. His vanitas paintings included the usual symbols of the transience and impermanence of human life, such as skulls, flowers, and burning or extinguished candles. He also included portraits of himself in these paintings, meaning to illustrate the ephemeral nature of his own artistic accomplishments. Though he sometimes intended his drawings as models for engravings, more often he made them as independently displayed works of art." .

The artist often represented the female form with this innovative and labor-intensive technique. With deeply-rooted sympathies for the labor movement and social causes, Baizerman also favored less common subjects including the manual worker and the urban poor.During his youth in Russia, Baizerman became involved in the Russian Bolshevik movement. In 1906, he and his brother robbed a bank in order to contribute to the revolutionary cause. After a year and a half in jail, Baizerman escaped with his father's assistance and fled to the United States. Settling in New York, he trained as a sculptor at several art schools, while also working as a housepainter, machinist, and dressmaker.In the 1920s, Baizerman began shaping copper by hand. He would forcefully hammer both sides of a cold copper sheet until a cocoon-like image appeared in relief. This arduous process allowed Baizerman to align his artistic practice with the daily toil of the manual laborer to whom he remained profoundly sympathetic. In addition to producing copper pieces, Baizerman created an ambitious series of small-scale statuettes in bronze and plaster as an homage to the urban worker. He pursued \"The City and the People\" throughout his life; at his death, the series featured more than fifty pieces--from the \"Crippled Sharpener\" to the \"Drunk Sailor.\" A second ongoing project, the \"Labor\" series, equally expressed Baizerman's political commitment and solidarity with the working-class.As Baizerman gained in prominence, he created larger copper pieces intended for the outdoors. The artist's technique also took its toll. The violent banging reduced Baizerman's motor control of his hands and also damaged his hearing. His exposure to poisonous chemicals from soldering metal led to his death of cancer at age 68." .

Reluctantly, he abandoned his studies to work for the Medicis, becoming Leopoldo de' Medici's bookkeeper in 1664. He later became a consultant for Leopoldo's drawings collection and gallery of artists' self-portraits. After Leopoldo's death, he served under Cosimo III de'Medici. Though an amateur, Baldinucci was a skilled draftsman and clay modeler. He primarily drew copies of religious images and chalk portraits of his acquaintances. Best known as a writer, Baldinucci's most important publication was the fundamentalNotizie de' professori del disegno da Cimabue in qua(Notes on teachers of drawing from Cimabue until now). Baldinucci's well-informed biographies of Italian and northern European artists comprise the first universal history of European figurative arts, expanding and increasing the accuracy of Giorgio Vasari'sLives of the Artists. Baldinucci published three volumes in his lifetime, and three appeared posthumously.He also wrote a biography of Gian Lorenzo Bernini commissioned by Queen Christina of Sweden, the first history of engraving and etching, and the first dictionary of artistic terms." .

He first studied in Strasbourg or Swabia around 1499. While in Albrecht Dürer's Nuremberg workshop from 1503 to 1507, he was nicknamed \"Grien,\" probably after his favorite color, green, and to distinguish him from other apprentices named \"Hans.\" Two years later he settled in Strasbourg, becoming a wealthy property owner active in civic affairs. From 1512 to 1517, Baldung moved to Freiberg im Breslau to paint its cathedral's eleven-panelaltarpiece,still in place today.Baldung was responsible for introducing supernatural and erotic themes into German art. He often depicted witches, also a local interest: Strasbourg'shumanistsstudied witchcraft and itsbishopwas charged with ferreting out witches. Toward the end of his life, Baldung increasingly represented secular subjects, reflecting the Reformation's constraints on religious art.Baldung's work was expressionistic, imaginative and vividly colorful. By the end, his style developedManneristfeatures: clashing colors and sinuous line combined withnaturalisticdetail. He createdwoodcuts, religious paintings, portraits, and designs for stained glass." .

By the mid-1850s, Édouard-Denis Baldus was the most successful photographer in France and at the height of his career. He began as a painter, turning to photography in 1849 when paper negatives were just becoming popular. Throughout much of his life, he listed himself in city directories as peintre photographe (painter photographer), in reference more to his training than to his practice. In 1851 Baldus became one of the forty founding members of the Société Héliographique, the first photographic organization in the world.Baldus specialized in images of the landscape, architecture, and railways. In 1851 the Commission des Monuments Historiques (Historic Monuments Commission) asked Baldus to document architecture in France. These assignments, which were awarded to several photographers, were calledmissions héliographiques. In 1855 Baldus received his largest commission to document the construction of the Musée du Louvre.Photographic enlargements were not yet possible in the 1850s, so Baldus's photographs were contact prints from negatives as large as 10 x 14 inches. He often joined together several negatives to produce panoramas, creating images on an even grander scale." .

Megalomania, greed, social climbing--these were his most conspicuous characteristics. For Bandinelli, wealth, nobility, and literary prowess were ways of proving that artists were more than mere craftsmen. Unfortunately, rather than concentrating on creating his best art, the talented sculptor squandered his time and gifts scheming to receive every commission offered by theMedici, then often spent inadequate time executing them.Bandinelli's father, a prominent Florentine goldsmith, was his most influential teacher, exposing him to Leonardo da Vinci's drawings and sculpture. Bandinelli studied ancient and contemporary sculpture, but most of all he studied Michelangelo, becoming first his imitator, then his rival.Bandinelli's greatest talent wasdisegno,that combination of design and drawing underlyingItalian Renaissanceart. He was also a gifted teacher. He founded one of the earliest academies at theVaticanin 1531 and created another in Florence around 1550." .

By January 1, 1755, when he was twenty-three years old, his salary had risen to sixtylivres.Only four months later, however, the director of Vincennes noted that he had \"put Bardet outside the doorbecause of his apathy and lack of application.\" As punishment, the painter was forced to paint cardboard boxes for eight months. Two years later, he was again shown the door for \"two new acts of disobedience.\" As his name does not appear again in the archives, Bardet probably decided to try another career.Bardet's mark, found on the bottom of several pieces attributed to him, consists of two parallel lines." .

As with most ancient artists, the true name of the Bareiss Painter is unknown. He is identified only by the stylistic traits of his work, especially by the way he draws horses.

In 1854 he moved his operation to Syracuse, New York, and began using the collodion process, a negative/positive process that allowed for multiple prints, unlike the unique daguerreotype.Along with Timothy O'Sullivan, John Reekie, and Alexander Gardner, Barnard worked for the Mathew Brady studio and is best known for his photo-documentation of the American Civil War. In 1864 he was made the official photographer for the United States Army, Chief Engineer's Office, Division of the Mississippi. He followed Union General William Tecumseh Sherman's infamous march to the sea and in 1866 published an album of sixty-one photographs,Photographic Views of Sherman's Campaign. After the war he continued primarily as a portrait photographer in Ohio, Chicago, Charleston, South Carolina, and Rochester, New York, where he briefly worked with George Eastman, the founder of the Eastman Kodak Company." .

Barnes's artistic circle included a group of wealthy patrons, painters, and intellectuals who spent their summers there, including Edgar Degas.Generally regarded as \"down on his luck,\" Barnes was nevertheless perpetually present among the group with his camera in hand. Degas and his friends engaged Barnes and his photographic skills to make their portraits and to collaborate on images, most notably Degas's photographic parody of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres's paintingApotheosis of Homer." .

He moved beyond the linear style of his teacher Battista Franco around 1563, when he discovered Correggio'ssfumatoeffects, which made the defining lines of forms appear to dissolve into delicately colored, smoky mists. Barocci's decorations for the Casino of Pope Pius IV at theVaticanused this technique and became so celebrated that they established his reputation as an up-and-coming young painter.Although his biographer Giovanni Bellori certainly exaggerated when he claimed that Barocci always worked from life, the artist did draw numerous preparatory studies. His diligence did not always please his patrons, however, for they often waited on his commissions.In 1565 Barocci returned to Urbino for good, claiming that he had been poisoned and working only two hours a day due to constant pain. Yet he continued to invent new compositional strategies, incorporating the viewer into his circle of foreground figures in theMadonna del Popoloof 1579 (Galleria degli Uffizi). The composition's emotional draw had a strong impact on Annibale and Lodovico Carracci and many younger painters." .

One contemporary wrote that the intricate ivory forms Barreau produced surpassed everything he had seen until then.Little is known of Barreau's early life because he did not gain widespread recognition until he was nearly seventy years old. He spent most of his life in the quiet town of Avignon. In 1794 he wrote to the newly established Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers (Conservatory of Arts and Crafts), offering several examples of his work for their collection. The Conservatoire's directors praised Barreau's \"patience and dexterity\" and purchased thirteen objects for the large sum of three thousand francs.Inspired by this recognition, Barreau moved to Paris in 1799 and installed himself at the Conservatoire, where he worked in secret on new forms. Although many craftsmen were eager to learn the exact techniques he used to create his delicate objects, Barreau never divulged his secret. To ensure that no one would learn his techniques, he even hired people who were deaf and could not speak. His final work was a complex ivory tower, produced forNapoleonI at a price of two thousand francs." .

Working in the northern Italian regions of the Veneto and Lombardy, he began as a painter of small, devotional paintings and developed into a fashionable portraitist. He probably trained with Venetian master Gentile Bellini. His earliest dated painting, aVirgin and Child,also shows the influence of Giovanni Bellini's paintings of that subject. In his early career Bartolomeo frequently copied and signed religious works by other painters from northeastern Italy such as the Bellinis.Bartolomeo worked at the Este court in Ferrara from 1505 to 1508, where he developed his style in the rich culture of theRenaissancecourt there. By 1520 he was a successful portrait painter in Milan, depicting fashionable young men in contemporary costume. Leonardo da Vinci had revived portraiture there and Bartolomeo's style displays Leonardo's influence. A strongchiaroscurogives structural coherence and a new psychological suggestiveness to his paintings, as in the Getty Museum'sLady Playing a Lute.Bartolomeo's sitters are characterized by elaborate costumes depicted in meticulous detail. In his late work, softer, more fluid handling shows his awareness of Titian's portraiture." .

He cites William Eggleston--known for his intensely colored images of ordinary scenes--and the earlier photographers Timothy O'Sullivan and Carleton Watkins--both known for their unique documents of the changing American landscape--as primary influences, Bartos focuses on the contemporary landscape. Yet, in his images, time seems to stand still, lending them an aura of temporal dislocation.In the early 1970s he attended film school at New York University and began working with color photography. He was mentored independently by the photographer Evelyn Hofer, known for her serene and meticulous color compositions.Bartos published perhaps his best-known work--photographs illustrating the effects of time on the modernist United Nations building in New York after fifty years of use--in the bookInternational Territory: The United Nations, 1945-95, 1995.During the summers of 1991-95 he made a photographic series on middle-class Long Island vacationers calledHither Hillspublished in the photography magazineDouble Takein 1997. In 2001 he publishedKosmos: A Portrait of the Russian Space Age,photographs of the \"obsolescent future\" of the Soviet space program.Boulevard(2006) features images of Los Angeles and Paris." .

After serving inNapoleon'sarmy, he studied sculpture and painting and entered theÉcole des Beaux-Artsin 1818. Like the painters Théodore Géricault and Eugène Delacroix, with whom he studied the animals at the Paris zoo, Barye exemplified theRomanticpredilection for exotic and violent subjects; many of his bronzes depict wild beasts in combat.At theSalonof 1831, he won a medal forTiger Devouring a Gavail,a crocodile-like creature.This large-scale sculpture's subject was a radical choice, departing from the Académie's strict hierarchy, which ranked the human figure as art's noblest subject and animals as one of the lowliest. With the success of this work, Barye began working independently as a sculptor and painter. He continued submitting his animal bronzes to the Salons, where they competed on equal terms with sculptures of more traditional human subjects.About 1845 Barye established afoundryto produce small bronzes for France's growing middle class.

A pioneer ingenre scenesand landscape painting, Jacopo initially trained with his father in the town of Bassano. By 1534 he had found his direction in the art of nearby Venice, learning as much from thechiaroscuroand luxurious color of Titian's works as from his teachers. He always stayed abreast of developments in Venetian painting, sometimes borrowing details from Lorenzo Lotto's works in his portraits. Engravings were critical in forming Jacopo's style, particularly those by and after artists like Albrecht Dürer, Raphael, and Parmigianino. Local taste required that art illustrate reality, and Jacopo drew inspiration from the simple human scenes, farm life, and changing aspects of nature he observed in his hometown. To Mannerism's energy, extreme movement, and tightly compressed space, he added realism and earthiness. A humble and subtle observer, his sitters may seem unaware of his presence. Increasingly, he used religious and philosophical subjects as pretexts for painting genre scenes and landscapes. Jacopo's workshop was a minor industry in Bassano, and his four sons continued his style into the next century." .

His early paintings show the influence of Andrea Mantegna's style, with an interest inclassical antiquityand rounded, sculptural forms.In Venice, Bastiani seems to have gravitated into the circle of artists working around Mantegna's in-laws, the Bellini family. In the 1460s he may have collaborated with Giovanni Bellini on threetriptychsfor a major Venetian church. In the 1480s he worked with Gentile Bellini for theScuolaGrande di San Marco, aconfraternitydedicated to doing good works. Bastiani's paintings from this time show an interest in depicting space in rigorousperspective. Disputing the extent of Bastiani's body of work, scholars have reattributed some of his early paintings to the young Giovanni Bellini." .

His delicate technique, elegant draftsmanship, and ability to tastefully incorporate ancient sculptures and monuments into his pictures dovetailed perfectly with Europe's vogue for theantique. A goldsmith's son, Batoni studied in Rome, basing his style in part on Raphael and on the art of antiquity. From 1735 he received many commissions foraltarpiecesas well as for mythological and historical pictures. He often took poses from real statues and used ancient literature as subject matter.Batoni's sensibility was joyful and elegant, mirroring the carefree attitude of eighteenth-century society as a whole. It is said that more than 150 Englishmen alone sat for him. His sitters appreciated his polished precision and the air of informal modernity he created by placing them in semi-natural settings featuring Roman sculptures, architecture, or archaeological finds--often those they themselves had admired or even acquired. He painted three popes and many princes, and his clients included Catherine the Great of Russia. Batoni became curator of the papal collections, and his home was a meeting place for Rome's intellectual and social elite." .

One of his earliest works, a landscape etching of 1658, shows the influence of Herman Saftleven.During the 1670s he painted the figures in a number of landscapes by Jacob van Ruisdael. Battem's thickly populated works on paper represent winter scenes, canals, and imaginary views of Dutch towns, while his rare oil paintings generally depict hilly, heavily wooded river valleys." .

His marriage to the daughter of a French furniture-maker probably allowed him to establish himself in Paris at a time when established French cabinetmakers vociferously opposed immigrant craftsmen arriving from Germany and other countries. About 1749 Baumhauer was made amarchand-ébéniste privilégié du roi(Dealer and Cabinetmaker to the King), without ever becoming a master in theguildofébénistes.He soon dropped his last name, which was unpronounceable for his French contemporaries, and used only Joseph, which he also put on his stamp." .

Bayard was reportedly persuaded by a friend of Daguerre to postpone the announcement of his findings, thus missing the opportunity to be recognized as the inventor of the medium. In 1840 he responded to this injustice by creating perhaps the first example of political-protest photography, a portrait of himself as a drowned man, upon which he wrote:The corpse which you see here is that of M. Bayard, inventor of the process that has just been shown to you. As far as I know this indefatigable experimenter has been occupied for about three years with his discovery. The Government, which has been only too generous to Monsieur Daguerre, has said it can do nothing for Monsieur Bayard, and the poor wretch has drowned himself. Oh the vagaries of human life...!In fact Bayard did not drown himself but continued to photograph until his death nearly fifty years later. He was the first photographer to be granted amission héliographiqueby the Commission des Monuments Historiques to document architecture in France." .

McPhee had been to Iceland the previous year to view a newly risen volcano with her father, the writer John McPhee, and returned with Beahan to view what she described as an \"apocalyptic landscape.\"The two women met in an introduction to photography class at Princeton taught by Emmet Gowin--known for intimate views of his own family--in 1977. McPhee went on to receive an MFA in photography at the Rhode Island School of Design. Beahan later studied at the Tyler School of Art, Temple University, also obtaining an MFA in photography.With their large-format view camera, Beahan and McPhee have traveled throughout the world revealing a variety of attitudes towards the natural environment. Their work demonstrates an understanding both of geology and culture, what they call the inextricable bind between \"nature and the human hand.\"No Ordinary Land: Encounters in a Changing Environment,1998, is their first book of photographs, and includes an afterword by John McPhee. In addition to photographing, both Beahan and McPhee teach photography to college students." .

John Goddard, a science lecturer at London's Polytechnic Institution, located downstairs from the studio on Regent Street in London, served as daguerreotypist, the person who actually operated the camera. The London newspaperThe Timesremarked favorably on the Beard studio's photographs: \"The likenesses which we saw were admirable, and closely true to nature, beauties and deformities being exhibited alike.\"Beard's studio was a great financial success, and in 1841 he obtained the sole patent for daguerreotypes in England, Wales, and the British colonies. In 1850, however, like many operators of photography studios, he went bankrupt because of legal disputes over payment of the license fees required to practice daguerreotypy. Beard continued to sell photographs until 1857, when he passed the business on to his son." .

From a young age, Beardsley displayed a natural aptitude for drawing. Despite little formal training, he devoted his energies to art and produced drawings that revealed broad influences including Greek vase-painting, Japanese prints,French Rococodecoration, and the paintings of Andrea Mantegna. Embarking upon a brief yet brilliant career, Beardsley received a commission to illustrate a new edition of the King Arthur legend in 1893. The following year he became the art editor and illustrator of a new quarterly journal,The Yellow Book.Beardsley's illustrations for Oscar Wilde's celebrated playSaloméearned him his greatest professional acclaim, but his professional association with the flamboyant Wilde led to dismissal from the journal. Beardsley quickly rebounded, however, and became principal illustrator of another new magazine. During this period he also illustrated numerous books and composed poetry and prose. Aware that he was dying of tuberculosis, Beardsley pushed himself to explore new psychological and erotic realms. Ill from the age of seven, he died in Paris at twenty-five." .

He photographed in Japan, India, Athens, Constantinople, the Crimea, and Palestine. He settled in Yokohama and from 1863 to 1877 made hundreds of ethnographic portraits andgenre scenesin Japan. He eventually opened a furniture and curio business in Burma.Beato's photographic career was also long affiliated with images of war. He photographed the Opium War in China in 1860 and the Sudanese colonial wars in 1885.While in partnership with his brother-in-law James Robertson in the 1850s, Beato documented the Indian Mutiny and its aftermath. Their photographs are believed to be the first to show human corpses on a battlefield. Beato and Robertson were also among the earliest photographers to work in the Holy Land." .

Although it was established under Colbert and subsidized by the state, the Beauvais works was a private enterprise run by a succession of entrepreneurs with varying degrees of success. Beauvais made tapestries for the wealthy bourgeoisie and nobility of France, as well as for export.One of the most popular early series of tapestries produced at Beauvais was titledLesGrotesques.With occasional variations, these patterns were woven in numerous sets for over sixty years. When Jean-Baptiste Oudry was made the director in 1734, the factory flourished and became, in the words ofVoltaire, \"the kingdom of Oudry.\" Oudry insisted on higher technical standards and designed tapestries that showed nature in various forms. When he was appointed director at the Gobelins manufactory, he stopped paintingcartoonsfor Beauvais and selected the young painter François Boucher as Beauvais's new designer. Boucher designed forty-five tapestries for Beauvais, includingThe Story ofPsycheandLoves of the Gods.Throughout the 1700s, Beauvais also produced furniture upholstery, often produceden suitewith sets of hangings." .

The artist spent several years in Rome, where he saw Raphael's and Michelangelo's works, and a trip to Florence exposed him to Leonardo da Vinci'schiaroscuro. By 1514 Beccafumi was developing characteristics usually associated with theMannerismof the next decade, creating both emotional and compositional tension and instability instead of the balance and harmony more typical ofRenaissanceart. In the later 1520s he became official painter to the Sienese republic and decorated many of Siena's churches with paintings andfresco. Beccafumi also designedmosaicsand worked as a sculptor, wood engraver, and etcher.From the beginning, Beccafumi's highly personal style was concerned with light: he made light vibrate to convey emotion or spiritual illumination. He achieved his effects through strongperspectiveandcontrapposto,soft colors, and elongated, elaborately intertwined figures." .

Rendered with absolute precision in large format, medium-contrast gelatin silver prints, each structure is centered against a cloudless sky, filling the picture frame. The Bechers tended to arrange their photographs in grids or sequence them in monographs, a standardized presentation that facilitates a comparative analysis of form. Influenced by the objectivity of photographic practices between the two World Wars and embraced by practitioners of Minimalist and Conceptual art in the 1960s and 1970s, the systematic nature of their approach has become a recognizable style.Born in Siegen in 1931, Bernd Becher studied painting and lithography at the State Art Academy in Stuttgart in the mid-1950s. Hilla Wobeser, born in Potsdam in 1934, trained and apprenticed as a commercial photographer. The two met in 1959 in Düsseldorf, where both attended the Art Academy. Together they began to photograph the industrial sites familiar to Bernd from his childhood. They married two years later. For the next four and a half decades, they collaborated on all aspects of their self-assigned project, documenting lime kilns, cooling towers, blast furnaces, winding towers, water towers, gas tanks, silos, and other industrial structures throughout Western Europe. Organizing prints into categories according to function, they emphasized a typological examination of structural form as a reflection of function in both exhibition and book formats.Not least of the Bechers' legacy is their lasting influence on subsequent generations of artists who use the photographic medium today, most notably the students taught by Bernd Becher at the Düsseldorf Art Academy between 1976 and 1996. Among his most renowned students are Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, Thomas Ruff, and Thomas Struth." .

Rendered with absolute precision in large format, medium-contrast gelatin silver prints, each structure is centered against a cloudless sky, filling the picture frame. The Bechers tended to arrange their photographs in grids or sequence them in monographs, a standardized presentation that facilitates a comparative analysis of form. Influenced by the objectivity of photographic practices between the two World Wars and embraced by practitioners of Minimalist and Conceptual art in the 1960s and 1970s, the systematic nature of their approach has become a recognizable style.Born in Siegen in 1931, Bernd Becher studied painting and lithography at the State Art Academy in Stuttgart in the mid-1950s. Hilla Wobeser, born in Potsdam in 1934, trained and apprenticed as a commercial photographer. The two met in 1959 in Düsseldorf, where both attended the Art Academy. Together they began to photograph the industrial sites familiar to Bernd from his childhood. They married two years later. For the next four and a half decades, they collaborated on all aspects of their self-assigned project, documenting lime kilns, cooling towers, blast furnaces, winding towers, water towers, gas tanks, silos, and other industrial structures throughout Western Europe. Organizing prints into categories according to function, they emphasized a typological examination of structural form as a reflection of function in both exhibition and book formats.Not least of the Bechers' legacy is their lasting influence on subsequent generations of artists who use the photographic medium today, most notably the students taught by Bernd Becher at the Düsseldorf Art Academy between 1976 and 1996. Among his most renowned students are Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, Thomas Ruff, and Thomas Struth." .

He studied withgenrepainter Adriaen van Ostade, and his early works recall his teacher's dark, freely executed, many-figured subjects, though Bega often showed more psychological insight. From 1653 to 1654 he visited Germany, Switzerland, and France, then returned to Haarlem to join theGuildofSaint Luke. His life was probably cut short by the plague.Bega's principal subjects were taverns, domestic interiors, and villages, with characters ranging from nursing mothers and prostitutes to gamblers andalchemists. Between about 1660 and 1664, his genre scenes became more colorful, less populated, more emotionally expressive, and more focused on the fine details of object textures. Among those influenced by Bega was Jan Steen. Later European artists imitated Bega's style and borrowed characters from his dramas. Bega also drew, etched, and made counterproofs in a variety of materials." .

Flemish-born, he trained in Paris as a weaver before eventually becoming the second director of the Beauvais tapestry manufactory in 1684. In his role as both financial and artistic director, Béhagle was responsible for commissioning new designs as well as for steering the state-subsidized manufactory through its chronic economic difficulties. Under his directorship, which lasted twenty-seven years, the factory produced some of its most popular and enduring tapestry designs, including the Grotesques series." .

During the 1520s Beham was especially active as an engraver, creating tiny technical masterpieces of marvelous detail. He also was interested inantiquityand at some point in his career may have worked with Marcantonio Raimondi in Bologna and Rome.In 1525, along with the other \"godless painters\" Hans Sebald Beham and Georg Pencz, Barthel was banished from Lutheran Nuremberg for asserting that he did not believe in baptism,Christ, or transubstantiation. Although soon pardoned, Barthel moved to Catholic Munich to work for the Bavarian dukes William IV and Ludwig X. There his outstanding skill distinguished him as one of Germany's principal portrait painters, sought out by such luminaries asEmperor Charles V. His portrayals were coolly objective, with a strong sense of three-dimensionality.Beham also was an early creator ofvanitasrepresentations, including sleeping children with skulls and women surprised by death. According to Joachim von Sandrart, he died in Italy on a trip sponsored by Duke William." .

His tiny engravings of widely varied subjects put him among the German printmakers whom scholars call the Little Masters. Known for both his intricate craft and his interest in depicting peasant life, Beham was equally comfortable in largerwoodcutformats. He also designed playing cards, wallpaper,coats of arms, and patterns for other artists. Behamilluminateda prayerbook forCardinalAlbrecht of Brandenburg,archbishopof Mainz, and also created his only surviving painting for the cardinal.In 1525 three \"godless painters\"--Hans Sebald, his brother Barthel Beham, and Georg Pencz--were banished from Nuremberg for asserting that they did not believe in baptism,Christ, or transubstantiation. They were able to return within months, but Beham was exiled again in 1528 for publishing a book believed to plagiarize an Albrecht Dürermanuscript. From about 1532 he worked in Frankfurt." .

When he was only twenty, Bélanger was admitted to the prestigious Académie Royale d'Architecture under the protection of the connoisseur the comte de Caylus. In 1767 he was appointed the court'sdessinateur des Menus Plaisirs(Designer of Entertainments). He rose to become its director ten years later, as well aspremier architecte(first architect) to the comte d'Artois, brother ofLouis XVI. Bélanger produced designs for important royal ceremonies, including the funeral ofLouis XV, Louis XVI's coronation coach, and a jewel cabinet for Marie-Antoinette, one of the first major works in theNeoclassicalstyle.Despite his numerous royal connections, Bélanger supported the ideals of theFrench Revolution. Nonetheless, he was imprisoned for six months in 1794. When the monarchy was restored in 1814, he was employed again to design the royal ceremonies and a new official French seal." .

The revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 forced most Protestants to flee France to escape religious persecution. Belin instead decided to renounce his faith and converted to Catholicism in order to continue his work at the court ofLouis XIV, king of France. Belin was the pupil of Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer, whose daughter he married, and whom he succeeded as a flower painter at the Gobelins tapestry manufactory.Belin painted floral murals in several of the royal châteaux, includingFontainebleauandVersailles, where he worked on theEscalier de la Reine(Queen's Staircase), since destroyed. He also collaborated with other painters, providing the floral borders in portraits and for tapestrycartoonsfor Gobelins from 1687. Towards the end of his life, the king honored him by providing him with a pension and lodgings in the Palais duLouvre." .

Bell's photographic career was long and varied. In 1848 he entered into a partnership with his brother-in-law in Philadelphia; the pair operated a daguerreian studio for two years, until Bell branched out on his own, at times collaborating with other operators.A veteran of the Mexican War, Bell joined the Union Army and, after fighting in the battles of Antietam and Gettysburg during the American Civil War, he was appointed chief photographer of the Army Medical Museum in Washington, D.C. He established a studio in Philadelphia, and in 1872 Lieutenant George Wheeler, engineer of the fourth United States Geological Survey, commissioned Bell to accompany him as photographer on an expedition into Arizona. His extensive field experience led to later work as photographer for the Pennsylvania railroad and with an expedition to Patagonia.Photography was a something of a family affair for Bell. His daughter Louise and her husband, William H. Rau, were also photographers." .

His father Jacopo headed a successful workshop where Giovanni and his brother Gentile painted until about 1470. The precisely organized, linear style of brother-in-law Andrea Mantegna was an early influence as well. Around 1475 the Sicilian Antonello da Messina brought oil painting to Venice, and Giovanni soon switched to the new technique. His vision remained contemplative and poetic, but his style became warmer and more luminous. Giovanni showed that landscape could establish mood rather than just acting as a backdrop, and he integrated figures harmoniously into his landscapes.Giovanni's large workshop producedaltarpieces, devotional works, and sensitive, compelling portraits, as well as highly influential half-length Madonnas. Through his workshop's activity, Giovanni directly or indirectly influenced the Venetian painters of his and the next generation, including Sebastiano del Piombo, Lorenzo Lotto, and Vittore Carpaccio. His work also deeply impressed Fra Bartolommeo, who visited Venice in 1507.  He spent his career exploring new ideas, including those of such illustrious pupils as Titian and Giorgione." .

Four days after his purchase, Bemis made his first photograph. Throughout the winter of 1841, he photographed in Boston; the following summer, he photographed in the White Mountains around Crawford Notch, New Hampshire, where he had recently relocated. Almost as quickly and enthusiastically as he had taken up the medium, Bemis abruptly ceased to photograph after a year and moved on to other interests.Spurned in romance shortly after his move to New Hampshire, Bemis built himself a mansion of granite and became an eccentric recluse. In an elegiac obituary published in 1881, he was described as \"not as odd as might be expected, yet sufficiently so to distinguish him from the ordinary run of men.\" At one time called \"the Lord of the Valley,\" Bemis named a lake, mountain, brook, ridge, and locality in New Hampshire's White Mountains for himself; the house that he built, now called Notchland, currently operates as a bed-and-breakfast inn." .

In seeking to renew artists' study of nature and to return to theclassicaltradition of Annibale Carracci and Raphael, Benefial anticipatedNeoclassicism.When one of his paintings was rejected for exhibition at the Pantheon in 1703, Benefial displayed it in a pharmacist's window. In 1720, when he protested Pope Clement XI's decree that only Accademia di San Luca members could teach drawing, the ruling got revoked. Benefial's 1718 papal commission for a Roman church won him the title of Cavaliere. His paintings displayed tangible human figures, complex treatment of space, and warm, luminous colors. Along withfrescoesandaltarpieces, he painted numerous portraits. Because he partnered with inferior artists who then received credit, his paintings have often been misidentified.When Benefial was finally elected into the Accademia di San Luca at age fifty-seven, he denounced its members' ignorance and mediocrity; he was expelled in 1755. His work then developed an almost cruderealism." .

In addition to producing books for powerful aristocrats such asCardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg, Bening worked for a group of international royalpatronsincludingEmperor Charles VandDon Fernando, theInfanteof Portugal. He specialized inbooks of hoursand is also known to have received commissions for painted genealogical tables and portablealtarpiecesonparchment. Bening's art continued the Flemish tradition of skillfully representing the muted natural light of haunting nocturnal scenes. His work also contributed to a newer Flemish practice of painting poetic landscape vistas.Simon learned his craft in the workshop of his father, the painter Alexander Bening, in Ghent. By 1500, he moved to Bruges. His career there developed quickly, and at least three times he served as dean of thecalligraphers, booksellers,illuminators, and binders'Guildof Saint John andSaint Luke. As his father taught him, so Simon taught his children. His eldest daughter, Livinia, becamecourt painterto Edward VI of England, and another daughter became a dealer in paintings,miniatures, parchment, and silk." .

At first he simply repaired the royal family's existing furniture and made functional objects such as firescreens, boxes, and bidets. Benneman then became the courtébéniste,copying and altering existing furniture to unify the interiors of the royal residences.As his work gained the Crown's admiration, large sums of money passed from the royal coffers to Benneman to outfit his workshop with tools and equipment for sixteen craftsmen. Under the direction of the sculptor Jean Hauré, who acted as coordinator, Benneman produced pieces in the style of suchébénistesas Jean-Henri Riesener and Jean-François Oeben. He also altered existing pieces of furniture by removingporcelainplaques andmountsfrom one piece and placing them on a new copy. The old piece then served as a base for a new design.Benneman continued to work throughout theFrench Revolution, although at a reduced level, but during theDirectoirehe gained a certain amount of new business. Scholars have difficulty assessing this cabinetmaker's personal style as his best-known objects are copies of other eighteenth-centuryébénistes." .

He built most of his own equipment, from his camera to a stereograph-mounting machine. Ever the inventor, he developed an instantaneous shutter that allowed him to stop action and built a solar printing house on iron rollers, now at the Smithsonian Institution, that could be rotated 280 degrees so that the printing racks could face the sun all day. With his first and second wives and five children, he ran the Bennett Studio from 1865 until 1908. That studio is still run by his descendents today.Summing up his career, Bennett wrote that his \"energies for near a lifetime have been used almost entirely to win such prominence as [he] could in outdoor photography.\" He was renowned as a landscape photographer who presented the Wisconsin Dells, now a major resort area, as a safe though untamed wilderness. In his zeal to represent his beloved landscape, Bennett was said to have engaged in a bit of deceit, such as whitewashing the interiors of caves to make their interiors visible on early glass plate negatives." .

He acquired the surnameBerchemwhile a young pupil in the studio of Jan van Goyen. After studying with Cornelis van Poelenburgh and Jan van Goyen, well-known Dutch landscape painters, Berchem adopted aclassicizingmanner and joined the second generation of Dutch Italianates. These painters' depictions of the Italian countryside bathed in warm southern light were in great demand in Holland. Although Dutch consumers admired his paintings for their evocative Italian settings, scholars are uncertain whether Berchem ever actually visited Italy. He may have simply based his paintings on drawings by artists who did visit Italy. At the age of fifty-seven, he settled in Amsterdam, where he continued to paintItalianatelandscapes until his death. He created over eight hundred paintings in his lifetime." .

Little is known about him, but his occupation is given as a miniature painter and mathematician in his signature on the base of the Getty's ownWinter Landscape with Numerous Figures on a Frozen River. Berents created \"genre scenes,\" including winter landscapes, like many of his predecessors such as Molijn, van Battem, and Avercamp. Recent scholarship traces several paintings, drawings and gouaches to him that are copies after paintings, prints, and maps by other artists. His detailed work provides us with an example of how Dutch artists of this period imitated the works of their predecessors." .

His pictures generally bear the monogramCVB, and his identity was unknown until the 1950s. He seems to have led a fairly isolated existence in Middelburg, and only four of his flower paintings have been identified. Van den Berghe may have been a pupil of flower painter Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder. In addition to flower pieces, he painted landscapes that recall those of Jan Brueghel the Elder. Records also state that he painted a kitchen scene in 1642. He painted the interior of the church at Middelburg after it was damaged by fire." .

The following year she married the artist Robert Michel. Together they pioneered the use of collage using photographs. Man Ray and Marcel Duchamp included their work inSociété Anonyme,a collection of works by mostly European Dada artists.In 1920 Bergmann-Michel moved to Vockenhausen, near Frankfurt. She concentrated on ink drawings and photo-collages, working primarily in the abstract Constructivist style. In the early 1930s she made several short documentary films, then she devoted herself to agricultural work on her family's property during the Nazi era from 1933 until 1945, resuming her artistic career thereafter." .

Born in 1598 in Naples, Bernini was a child prodigy, receiving his early training in sculpture from his father and completing his first bust at the age of ten. He arrived in Rome at the age of seven and there built his extraordinary career.Bernini was an astonishingly prolific artist, receiving both sculptural and architectural commissions from royalty across Europe; he also painted and wrote comedies. Admiring his tremendous energy, a contemporary recorded that \"Bernini... gave a public opera wherein he painted the scenes, cut the statues, invented the engines, composed the music, wrote the comedy, and built the theater.\"Only at the age of sixty-six did Bernini leave his beloved city of Rome when summoned by Louis XIV to France for six months. Throughout this trip the famous artist was treated royally, more as a hero or prince than a craftsman. When Bernini died in 1680 at the age of eighty-two, he was buried with great pomp in Rome and mourned by all of Europe." .

Bertin's paintings are firmly rooted in the Neoclassical school of painting, characterized by tight compositions and smooth brushwork, as well as mythological or antique subjects. But Bertin was also an early proponent of sketching outdoors--a practice of direct observation in order to replicate nature in studio-made paintings of imagined, idealized scenes. Bertin encouraged the practice ofplein airto his students, and it later it became a respected genre in its own right.Bertin attended the Royal Academy of Painting in Paris, initially as a student of history painting, the most highly regarded genre in a rigidly structured, academic salon system. For three years he studied with history painter Gabriel-François Doyen. By 1788, he discovered an interest in landscape painting and entered the studio of Neoclassical painter Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes. Valenciennes devised a new category, thepaysage historique, which infused landscape painting with an idealized, heroic view of history in order to bolster respect for the lowly genre. Bertin embraced it throughout his career.Plein airpainting in Italy was a longstanding tradition for aspiring landscape painters. Bertin made scenes of precisely identified Italian locations, suggesting that he may have visited between 1806 and 1808. He painted outdoors in the Ile-de-France region near his home in Paris. Bertin's most famous student was Camille Corot, whose art later influenced the Impressionist painters." .

Besnier also distinguished himself as the co-director of the Beauvais Manufactory from 1734 to 1753.When the painter Jean-Baptiste Oudry was named director of Beauvais in 1734, he selected his great friend Besnier to join him. Not only an accomplished artist but also an astute businessman, Besnier looked after the commercial side of the factory while Oudry concentrated on artistic matters. Before the Besnier-Oudry partnership, Beauvais had continually lost money and frequently had difficulty paying its workers, buying wool and silk, and commissioning newcartoons. The two friends realized that they had to increase sales by providing new designs to reflect changing tastes. Their ideas were immediately successful, and they were soon able to hire new weavers to complete numerous orders from as far away as Denmark and Sweden.After about twenty years as the director of Beauvais, Besnier finally retired in December 1753 and died six months later." .

After studying with his uncle Pieter Aertsen, who pioneered the new subjects of kitchen and market scenes, Beuckelaer took up this genre. These popular pictures displayed abundant food, with people either standing around or preparing a meal, while thebackgroundnearly always contained a religious scene. The paintings often had a moralizing purpose, illustrating the opposition between worldly and spiritual values and warning of the pleasures of the flesh.Beuckelaer sometimes placed scenes in idealized townscapes, but he also created richly peopled wooded landscapes and riverbanks, with a strong sensitivity for atmosphere. He had no immediate followers in Antwerp, but his work was popular in northern Italy, inspiring Annibale Carracci to paint market and kitchen scenes. According to contemporary biographers, Beuckelaer flooded the market with inexpensive paintings, which only became valuable after his death. He frequently worked for other artists and probably participated in monumental projects for churches. From the later 1560s, he used canvas rather than panel and concentrated on large formats." .

By 1476 he had established himself as an independent painter in Faenza, where he remained for at least thirty years and built a largebottega,or workshop. He continued to work in other parts of Italy as well. Biagio collaborated with Domenico Ghirlandaio, considered the bestfrescopainter in Florence, incorporating Ghirlandaio'scompositionsand facial types into his own paintings. Biagio favored the bright, crystalline colors, carpets of flowers,genredetails, and landscape backgrounds of northern European art, though scholars are uncertain about precisely how he became exposed toFlemishand German painting. Biagio painted many religious subjects, particularly theMadonna and Child,and he may also have mademiniaturesfor aBible. In his mythological andclassicalsubjects, Biagio animated his pictorialnarrativeswith rich and highly colored costumes and armor. He created many panels forcassoni,the elaborately carved and decorated marriage chests that held a bride's trousseau." .

After some rudimentary painting instruction from his older brother, Bidauld attended theÉcole des Beaux-Artsin Lyon. In 1783 he moved toParis, where the perfumer and art dealer Dulac became hispatron. Dulac paid for Bidauld to go to Italy, where he remained for five years; while there, he dedicated himself exclusively to landscape painting. Bidauld's journey was to have a fundamental impact on his artistic outlook, which remained nearly unchanged for the next sixty years. His paintings have cool lighting, meticulously painted foliage and architecture, and sweeping vistas that conformed to then-popular precepts about Neo-classical landscapes. Bidauld regularly exhibited at the ParisSalonbetween 1791 and 1844, winning a gold medal in 1812. When Neo-classicism lost favor, Bidauld was unable to adapt to changing styles and, as a consequence, fell out of fashion. Though at the height of his career he counted Charles IV, Napoléon, and Louis XVIII among his patrons, Bidauld died in poverty." .

As Protestants, the Billers specialized in secular rather than church pieces, supplying table services for the royal courts of Northern Europe, including those in Russia, Berlin, Dresden, Sweden, and Denmark. Some of the members of the three generations of the Biller family seem to have collaborated on certain commissions. Albrecht and Johann Ludwig I carried out one of the family's most important commissions for Frederick III, king of Prussia. Pieces by Johann Ludwig I are extremely rare. He worked in a transitional style between theBaroqueworks of his father and the splendidRococometalwork of his son, Johann Ludwig II." .

He first trained with his father, a landscape painter. In the late 1640s he entered the workshop of Valerio Castello, a painter of violent contrasts and fiery, scintillating color. Biscaino's early paintings strongly recalled his master's style, but his forms were softer, his brushstroke broader, and his choice of colors more delicate. Curving draperies and sweetness of expression typified Biscaino's manner.Scholars often date Biscaino's his canvases on the basis of his forty catalogued etchings, and he remains best known for his drawings and prints.  Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione influenced theiconographyand technique of Biscaino's etchings. In his rendering of animals, figures, andnaturalisticsettings, and the play of light and shade, Castiglione also provided an important example for Biscaino's later paintings." .

A lawyer by profession, he set up practice in The Hague around 1652 and later founded a drawing academy there. He mingled with an elite circle of intellectuals that included his friend and fellow amateur draftsman Constantijn Huygens the Younger.Bartholomeus Breenbergh, who lived in de Bisschop's native Amsterdam for a time, most influenced de Bisschop's draftsmanship. De Bisschop's landscapes in brown inkwashimitated Breenbergh's evocations ofItalianatesunlight. Despite drawing numerous Italianate landscapes, de Bisschop probably never went to Italy; other artists' works were his sources. Whether drawing with pen or brush, de Bisschop used a warm golden-brown ink, later named \"bisschops-inkt\" after him.In addition to landscapes, de Bisschop made figure studies and drawings afterclassicalsculptures and famous paintings, primarily by Italian artists.

After trying his luck as a painter in Boston, he turned to photography, beginning as adaguerreotypeplate polisher. His career was marked by experimentation and innovation; as might be deduced from the above quotation, it did not include portraits. In collaboration with the balloon navigator Samuel A. King, Black made the first successful aerial photographs in the United States in 1860. He later became the authority on the use of the magic lantern, a candlelight-powered projector that was a predecessor of today's slide projectors. By the late 1870s Black's business largely consisted oflantern slideproduction, including his famous images of the Great Boston Fire of 1872." .

The workshop was active in the early 300s B.C in Apulia in South Italy. These artists decorated a variety of vessels in the red-figure technique. The painters of this group were particularly interested in depicting emotion and frequently rendered the faces of their subjects in three-quarter view, rather than in profile, which made it easier to convey facial expressions. As with most ancient artists, the real names of the painters in the Black Fury Group are unknown. They are identified only by the stylistic traits of their work. Scholars named the Black Fury Painter and the Black Fury Group after a fragment of a vase depicting a Fury with a black face." .

He believed that the arts offered insights into the metaphysical world and could potentially redeem a humanity fallen into materialism and doubt. His belief that imagination is the artist's critical filter indicated the dawn of Romanticism, but his peers failed to recognize his genius until his later years. A hosiery salesman's son, Blake trained by attending drawing school in London in 1767, apprenticing to an engraver, and enrolling in the Royal Academy's school in 1779. During the 1780s Blake worked as a commercial engraver and publishing his poems at home. With his wife's assistance, he printed the combined illustration and text from one plate and colored the illustrations by hand or printed the colors over the black outlines. He also bound and sold his own volumes, includingSongs of Innocenceof 1788 and its sequel,Songs of Experienceof 1794. Blake worked in pen, watercolor, and a kind of tempera but rejected oil painting.In the 1820s, he became the center of a group of younger English artists who shared his religious seriousness, including Samuel Palmer. One of these artists commissioned him to create two series of large watercolors, one inspired by the Book of Job and one by Dante'sDivine Comedy." .

In 1847 Blanquart-Evrard became the first to publish the procedure for the calotype negative/positive paper process in France. He specialized in printing and issuing portfolios of photographs by other photographers, but perhaps his most significant contribution was the introduction in 1850 of thealbumenpaper print process, the primary printing medium until gelatin papers superceded it in the late 1800s.Once a painter on ivory andporcelain, Blanquart-Evrard sent examples of his experiments with negative/positive paper processes to the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace in London in 1851. A note attached to a frame explained: \"These prints were obtained by a new process which makes it possible to produce two or three hundred prints from the same negative the same day in rainy weather.\" That same year Blanquart-Evrard started a printing company, the Imprimerie Photographique,to mass-produce photographic prints by other photographers, including John Beasly Greene, Charles Marville and Henri Le Secq. He later founded the successful and influential Blanquart-Evrard Printing Company for the same purpose." .

He worked under six masters, for one of whom he was also a houseboy. He absorbed theMannerismof the School ofFontainebleau, which stayed with him for life. Except for a short period in Amsterdam, he lived in Utrecht, becoming so important that Peter Paul Rubens visited him in 1627. Around 1600, landscape became increasingly vital to his art; over time, the subject matter of these landscapes became incidental, even difficult to find. Bloemaert's landscapes incorporated Mannerism's restless light effects and strong contrasts, richly coloredpalette, and lots of movement and detail. François Boucher later recognized a kindred spirit, incorporating many of Bloemaert'smotifsin his painting.In the 1620s Bloemaert's pupil Gerrit van Honthorst imported Caravaggio's ideas to Utrecht from Italy. Bloemaert developed a decorative synthesis of Caravaggio's contrasting light effects and Mannerism's bright, acid colors. Always open to fresh ideas, Bloemaert depicted mythological and religious subjects completely new to Dutch art, designed tapestries, stained-glass windows, and made over 1,500 drawings. In 1611 he co-founded Utrecht'sGuildofSaint Luke. Widely influential through his engravings, Bloemaert also taught a generation of Utrecht's best artists, including Hendrick Ter Brugghen and Cornelis van Poelenburgh." .

Blumberg first gained attention for his seriesIn Front of St. Patrick's Cathedral(1973). In those images, he emphasized the starkly lit shapes of Roman Catholic worshippers as they stood or walked out of the cathedral's cavernous entrance on Fifth Avenue in New York City. Blumberg was inspired by the untrained vision of young gang members he had taught while volunteering for an urban anti-poverty program. Blumberg later said of their pictures: \"Images were often fragmented, hands and heads truncated by the frame's edge. Figures floated upside down and obliquely, without regard to traditional horizontal-vertical relationships and perspective.\"Blumberg initially trained as a scientist, earning degrees in biology from Cornell University in 1959 and the University of Colorado in 1961. A trip to Europe during graduate school changed the course of his life. Heady from experiencing works of art such as J. W. M. Turner's seascapes in London and Byzantine mosaics in Ravenna, he completed his degree, and then moved to New York City, where he initially sought out his subject matter in the streets. His work became increasingly conceptual, exploring principles that are intrinsic to the medium of black and white photography, specifically the relationship of figure to background, the tension between two-dimensional representation and three-dimensional reality, and the possibilities presented by the gray scale inherent to black-and-white photography.In the mid-1960s, Blumberg's photographs were featured in exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art and the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York. In 1965, Blumberg began a long career teaching photography in university art programs, which in turn inspired his own work as he considered the relationship between formal learning and art making. He taught at the State University of New York at Buffalo (1965-81) and the Otis Art Institute of Parsons School of Design in Los Angeles (1981-90). Among his best-known portfolios and books are:Daily Photographs(1972),Portraits of Students(1972), andIn Front of St. Patrick's Cathedral(1973)." .

The archbishops of Granada valued Bocanegra above all other painters in the city and appointed him painter to thecathedralchurch. Later in his career, Bocanegra worked in Seville and Madrid, where he becamecourt painterin 1676.In 1670 Bocanegra painted the life of the Virgin for a church in Granada; these paintings displayed Cano's influence in their lively coloring and dynamiccompositions, along with vigorous Baroqueillusionisticeffects. Bocanegra's late style still showed Cano's imprint, which he combined with his own softness of modeling and sentimentality. He painted mostly religious subjects and some portraits. Highly prolific and in demand, Bocanegra seems to have sacrificed quality for quantity." .

Only six pictures are definitely known to be his, but he probably painted many figure groups within paintings attributed to the Rubens school. Between 1635 and 1637, Boeckhorst toured Italy, returning in 1639 to see Rome.Boeckhorst worked both independently and in collaboration with other artists. Early in his career he added staffage, flowers, and animals to other artists' paintings; later on, he painted figures for them as well. In the 1630s he contributed figures to Frans Snyders's paintings; in turn, Snyders added still life elements to Boeckhorst's works. After Rubens's death in 1640, Boeckhorst finished and touched up some of his master's paintings. Until about 1650, Boeckhorst's figure types and compositions closely follow Rubens's late work; after that Anthony Van Dyck's influence can be felt. After 1650 Boeckhorst painted numerous altarpieces and other works for churches and monasteries outside Antwerp, along with paintings of the Old Testament and mythological subjects for private individuals and art dealers. He also made tapestry designs and drawings for publication." .

As with many ancient sculptors, we know of his work primarily from passing references by Roman writers such asPlinyandPausaniasand from later Roman copies of his sculptures. One signed original statue by Boethos survives: a bronzehermfrom a shipwreck off the coast of Tunisia near the city of Mahdia, now in the Bardo Museum in Tunis. The Getty Museum's herm so closely resembles the one in Tunis, both stylistically and technically, that it too must have been made in Boethos's workshop.The two similar herms, one signed and one unsigned, raise questions about the role of the artist and the organization of workshops in ancient Greece. In bronze casting, numerous versions of a work can be produced from the same mold, making the precise role of the artist signing the work unclear. Does the signature of Boethos mean that he created the original mold from which these two slightly different castings were made? Or does it mean that he was the artist who customized this mold with the more elaborate detailing found on the Mahdia herm?" .

As a teenager, he studied painting in the provinces, moving to Paris in 1785 only after ascertaining the marketability of his genre scenes. He established himself as a painter of slightly naughty images, which were especially popular with patrons who enjoyed the mischievous side of life. In 1794, an erotic painting elicited accusations of obscenity--an offense that carried the threat of prison and harsh penalties. A keen observer of human behavior, Boilly turned his attention to more public scenes, depicting the social customs of Parisians at the Salon, on the promenade, at the billiard table. He meticulously recorded facial details and gestures, and his depictions of costumes and textiles are fascinating as a chronicle of fashion. Boilly's paintings and drawings, often tinged with humor, showcase the artist's witty interpretation of urban life." .

A first-rate craftsman, a gifted designer, and son of one of the designers at the Gobelins tapestry factory, Boizot studied at the Académie Royale in Paris and in Rome as the winner of the Prix de Rome in 1762. After being received as a full member of the Académie Royale in 1778, he exhibited regularly at the Paris Salon until 1800.Boizot worked primarily with small-scale and decorative sculpture, designing pieces such as gilt bronze clocks, caryatids for a chimneypiece at the Château de Fontainebleau, ornamental centerpieces, and even a toilet seat for the Comtesse du Nord. As artistic director of the sculpture studio at the Sèvres porcelain manufactory beginning in 1773, he oversaw the design of more than 150 models reproduced in biscuit porcelain, including official portrait busts of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette.During the French Revolution, which he supported, Boizot was an advocate for the preservation of historical monuments through his role in the Commission des Monuments. Although he had difficulty adapting to the Republican-favored Neoclassical style, he still received commissions for public monuments." .

Bol witnessed a document concerning Rembrandt's wife Saskia's inheritance in 1640, a responsibility that suggests that by then Bol was probably no longer a student but a full-fledged assistant.After having risen quickly through the ranks in Rembrandt's highly productive studio, Bol established himself as an independent master around 1642. He imitated Rembrandt's style so closely that some works were mistaken for Rembrandt's for centuries afterward. Although his style changed, throughout his career Bol painted the same subjects as Rembrandt: histories, portraits--often with sitters posed by a window--and exotically costumed single figures.Around 1650 Bol's taste drifted to more \"modern\" trends: Hispalettelightened, and his figures grew more noble and elegant. No other painter in Amsterdam equaled him in receiving official commissions; his 1653 marriage to a woman from an influential family undoubtedly helped. Among Bol's most important works wereclassicizingBaroquepaintings of historical subjects for Amsterdam's new town hall. After marrying a wealthy widow in 1669, he gave up painting." .

At age fourteen he was apprenticed to a painter ofWaterschilderen, large-scale scenes painted on canvas using opaque watercolor ortempera.Waterschilderen,a specialty of artists in Mechelen, were used as wall decorations instead of expensive tapestries. According to Karel Van Mander, Bol's large watercolors were widely copied. He thus turned to making miniatures inbodycoloronparchment, which he promoted as independent cabinet paintings; these earned him a good income and an international clientele. Despite the war with Spain and periods of religious unrest that caused frequent upheavals in his life, Bol remained one of the Netherlands' most prolific and successful landscapists. He painted some oil paintings,illuminatedabreviaryfor a French duke, and made many drawings that were the basis for engravings. His pupils included Joris Hoefnagel.Bol's works combined artifice andnaturalismin formats ranging from extensive panoramas to intimate views of theFlemishcountryside, usually including small figures enacting a biblical or mythological scene, anallegory, or agenre scene." .

An art historian at the time wrote that despite Bompiani's conservative approach, \"he showed himself open to new ideas and emancipated himself in his best work almost entirely from what was narrow and conventional in the style imposed upon him by his early training.\"In later years, Bompiani increasingly painted landscape watercolors. In the late 1870s, he began painting a series of portraits that included his wife and members of the Borghese family. He served as a professor and ultimately president of the RomanAccademia di San Luca." .

He painted his earliest known work, a still life, while employed as a clerk for the Paris police. Deeply inspired by the Dutch master paintings of the 1600s that he saw at theLouvre, Bonvin painted still lifes andgenre scenescharacterized by a quiet, intimate, and meditative style. Many of his genre scenes display Pieter de Hooch's influence.After becoming acquainted with Gustave Courbet, Bonvin became a leading exponent ofRealism. Though he had little money, he encouraged and supported other artists, frequently giving supplies to his talented half-brother, Leon Bonvin. When theSalonrejected his fellow Realists James McNeill Whistler and Henri Fantin-Latour in 1859, Bonvin exhibited their work in hisatelier. In his later years, he spent time in the Netherlands and London before settling in a small French village. He continued to draw and paint everyday objects and local scenes with delicately rendered light and shadow." .

He was largely self-taught, though his older half-brother François, who had garnered recognition among Paris's Realist painters, encouraged him and gave him supplies. Bonvin's earliest drawings were small, somber charcoal and ink sketches of his bleak environment.While earning his living as an innkeeper, Bonvin drew directly from nature, recording the fields and flowers near his home and interior views of the inn. By the 1860s, he had turned exclusively to watercolor, creating landscapes and still lifes with remarkable luminosity. François encouraged him to study the Dutch andFlemishmasters' meticulousrealismand use of outline. By outlining the forms in sepia-toned ink, Bonvin achieved distinctive, almost photographic effects in his watercolors. After his marriage in 1861, Bonvin's financial situation worsened and his inn lost money. In January 1866 he traveled to Paris to try to sell his watercolors. The day after an art dealer refused his work, the despairing artist hanged himself in the forest of Meudon.

He was also asked to appraise the engraving plates of another mapmaker.Borde did not limit himself to engraving maps but also financed their costly production. He frequently acted as the publisher, providing the money needed for engraving the copper plate, supervising the various stages of printing, and distributing the maps. In return, he remained the owner of the plates." .

When Bordone received his first commission in 1518, the powerful Titian promptly took it for himself. After winning a 1534 competition that failed to attract important Venetian commissions, Bordone found work elsewhere.The particulars of Bordone's artistic development remain unclear, because he repeated figure studies from his model book throughout his career. Always consistent, however, was his delight in texture and detail, seen in luxurious fabrics, lustrous gems, and soft, supple skin. Around 1538 he worked atFontainebleau, where his style absorbed the rhythmic grace, expressive artifice, and sensuality of the other Italian painters there. Bordone increasingly became identified with glossy portraiture, frequently illustrating the theme of problematic love. He often painted beautiful courtesans and erotic mythological andallegoricalsubjects, which appealed to his wealthy clients.After meeting Lorenzo Lotto in Venice during the 1540s, Bordone imbued his portraits with a new intimacy. He traveled extensively in the 1540s and 1550s, working in Milan, Bavaria, Fontainebleau, and his native Treviso. Around 1560 Bordone again returned to Venice, then as one of its most famous artists." .

He decorated vases in theblack-figure techniqueand may also have been a potter. As with most vase-painters, the real name of the Boreads Painter is unknown, and he is identified only by the style of his work, namely his particular way of drawing figures' eyes, ears, knees, and hips and his habit of encircling the pictures on the interior of his cups with a band of pomegranates.The Boreads Painter is named for an image of the winged sons ofBoreas, the god of the north wind, pursuing the Harpies, on a cup now in Rome in the Museo del Villa Giulia. Although scholars have identified only a few works by this vase-painter, he probably decorated only cups, not larger vessels." .

Not surprisingly, flower painters were among the best-paid artists. In 1621, Ambrosius Bosschaert commanded a thousand guilders for a single flower picture. Nonetheless, his output was relatively small, for he was also an art dealer, handling works by artists like Paolo Veronese. Anticipating religious persecution, in 1587 Bosschaert's parents moved from Antwerp to Middelburg, a seaport and trading center second in importance only to Amsterdam. Six years later Bosschaert joined Middelburg'sGuildofSaint Luke. Bosschaert originated agenrethat continued in that city until the mid-1600s: a symmetrically composed bouquet of flowers painted with seemingly scientific accuracy, more voluminous than those of his Antwerp contemporary Jan Brueghel the Elder. Bosschaert's works have been called flower portraits; each flower receives the same detailed attention as a face in a portrait. Usually small scale and on copper, Bosschaert's paintings combined blooms from different seasons, painted from separate studies of each flower. It is not unusual to find the same flower, shell, or insect in many pictures. Like his predecessors, Bosschaert sometimes included symbolic or religious meanings, such as the transience of life." .

In Rome between 1785 and 1801, he met writers, scholars, archaeologists, andNeoclassicalartists. He studied ancient andRenaissanceart and, to hone his figure drawing skills, drew corpses at a local hospital.In 1802 Bossi traveled to Lyon, France, where he met Neoclassical painters such as Jacques-Louis David. His style acquired a contemporary, sociopolitical slant and later embracedRomanticism, incorporating a more poetic and sensual approach. Back in Milan, Bossi served as secretary at the academy until 1807. He developed a major library and founded its art gallery, acquiring important paintings by such artists as Raphael. He also prevented many works from being smuggled abroad or dispersed.Bossi always associated with intellectuals and artists--Antonio Canova was a great friend and admirer--and displayed a range of interests. After making a replica of Leonardo da Vinci'sLast Supper,he released an ambitious and learned publication about the painting in 1810. A passionate archaeologist and book lover, Bossi also collected drawings, prints, paintings, coins, sculptures, and antiques." .

When he was only nineteen years old, Böttger caught the attention of Frederick Augustus I, Elector of Saxony, who heard the young man's boast that he could produce gold from base metals. The impoverished ruler, welcoming the opportunity to refill his state's coffers, quickly summoned him. The supposed gold-maker panicked and fled but was soon caught and ordered to stay under virtual house arrest until he revealed his secret formula. While trying to produce heat-resistant crucibles for goldmaking, Böttger developed an especially hard and dense red stoneware.For nearly six years, Böttger experimented desperately. Although unable to produce gold, he did manage to make another important breakthrough-the recipe for \"true\" or hard-paste porcelain. Until his discovery, Europeans had had to rely on costly imports of Chinese and Japanese porcelain to satisfy their desire for this delicate material. On March 28, 1709, Böttger finally perfected translucent white porcelain. The Elector quickly established a manufactory at Meissen to start production and hired others to help refine the new material and to create colored enamels to decorate it. Böttger discovered few colors before his death but still managed to revolutionize the porcelain market." .

Boucher's paintings and drawings celebrated a silvery, shimmering world of perfumes and powders, inspiring copies of his designs in media ranging from textiles andmarquetrytoporcelain.Boucher began his career engraving Jean-Antoine Watteau's works. The native Parisian won thePrix de Romein 1723 but he admired little in Italy. In 1734 he became a member of theAcadémie Royaleand the following year obtained his first commission forVersailles. From then on, his sparklingRocococonfections graced stage sets and the most important decorations and remodeling of royal residences and town houses. He gained renown for his charmingly suggestive mythological scenes, ultimately inspired by Peter Paul Rubens and Jean-Antoine Watteau. In 1749 he began teaching engraving and drawing toLouis XV'smistress,Madame de Pompadour, and by 1765 he was named first painter to the king and director of the Académie.Boucher also designed tapestrycartoonsfor the Beauvais Tapestry Manufactory and in 1756 became the supervisor of the Gobelins manufactory. His designs had a significant impact on the decorative arts throughout Europe, especially at Sèvres, where his designs were painted on and modeled in porcelain." .

His paintings stress those values: precise drawing, contour, and finish, along with strict adherence to the rules of anatomy,perspective, academic modeling, and physiognomic expression in which internal character is revealed by outward appearance. An heir of Jacques-Louis David and Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Bouguereau's subjects includedClassical, mythological,allegorical, or Orientalist themes, as well as contemporary history. Most of his works were popularly known through engravings.From 1843 to 1850, Bouguereau studied at theÉcole des Beaux-Arts, winning thePrix de Romein 1850. When he returned from Rome, Bouguereau decorated several great houses, drawing his inspiration from thefrescoesatPompeiiand Herculaneum. He was awarded a medal of honor at the Paris exhibition of 1878 and in the 1885Salon. Bouguereau's academic renderings were highly regarded by many of his contemporaries, but they were exactly what theImpressionistsrebelled against. When Pierre-Auguste Renoir was being fitted with new glasses to correct his myopia, he threw the spectacles on the floor, crying:Bon Dieu, je vois comme Bouguereau!(\"Good God, I see like Bouguereau!\")" .

Although he did not invent the technique, Boulle was its greatest practitioner and lent his name to its common name: boulle work. Boulle also specialized in floral marquetry in both stained and naturally colored wood. Many of his designs are illustrated in a book of engravings published around 1720.Before 1666 Boulle was awarded the title of master cabinetmaker; in 1672 the king granted him the royal privilege of lodging in the Palais duLouvre. In the same year, he achieved the title of cabinetmaker and sculptor toLouis XIV, king of France. This new title allowed him to produce furniture as well as works ingiltbronze such as chandeliers, wall lights, andmounts. Although strictguildrules usually prevented craftsmen from practicing two professions simultaneously, Boulle's favored position allowed him protected status and exempted him from these statutes." .

He never went to Italy, yet his theories greatly influenced the development ofNeoclassicalarchitecture there.Boullée wanted to be a painter but switched to architecture at his father's insistence. He learned to make architectural drawings withpainterlyeffects of light and shadow. Although few of his designs were ever realized, his drawings have always been admired for both their beauty and their invention.By the 1780s Boullée focused only on his roles as educator, academician, and theoretician. Committed to ideas of symbolic power, he believed that architecture could elicit moral and emotional responses when the combination of forms suggested a union with divinity. He theorized that the abstract, geometric forms he used were the basis for beauty through their regularity, symmetry, and variety.Boullée preserved his principles in a treatise, which he illustrated with magnificent drawings for public projects he designed between 1778 and 1788, but the treatise remained unpublished until 1953. Through his pupils as well as the architectural prize competitions for theAcadémie Royale, Boullée inspired generations of draftsmen, visionaries, and builders." .

He may have studied with Simon Vouet, and he was profoundly influenced by therealismof the art of Caravaggio and his followers. He was Nicolas Poussin's friend; the two young Frenchmen may have met for the first time in Rome, the artistic mecca and crossroads of all classes and nationalities. De Boulogne only documented work hung inSaint Peter's Basilicanext to Poussin's only public picture in Rome. Both men painted religious and secularcompositionsfor privatepatrons, but their art could not have been more different. Poussin's approach was intellectual: he insisted on harmony in his compositions, and he painted the ideal and the abstract. De Boulogne's approach, on the other hand, was personal and dramatic. He infused his pictures with melancholy, even sadness. Hisgenre scenescaptured the seedy, coarse aspects of life, much of which he probably experienced in the rough melting pot that was Rome. DiplomatCardinal MazarinandLouis XIVwere early collectors of his works." .

However, when he copied and exhibited a Claude Lorrain landscape after visiting the master's studio, Claude was so angry that \"M. Bourdon could barely escape violence.\"The successful Bourdon was frequently criticized for his versatility, which contemporaries blamed on lack of serious training. Born into an artistic family, he went to Paris at age seven, apprenticing to a painter of uncertain identity from 1623 to 1630. Following stints in Bordeaux and Toulouse, he went to Rome, where he painted copies of renowned artists' works for a picture dealer.After visiting Venice, Bourdon returned to Paris in 1637 and soon receiving lodgings in the Palais duLouvre. He became famous for his large Baroque religious and classical subjects painted with Venetian richness of handling. In 1648 Bourdon co-founded theAcadémie Royale de Peinture et de Sculptureand later lectured there, recommending that young artists reject uniformity of inspiration.In 1652 Bourdon became first painter to Sweden's Queen Christina, portraying numerous court figures in a style inspired by Anthony van Dyck. His last works, made back in Paris, were landscape-oriented and influenced by Poussin's art, to which Bourdon added tenderness, charm, and cool color." .

He eventually established a large workshop that employed his two sons. Bouts painted a range of subjects in a style characterized by elongated, calm, reflective figures; rich, controlled colors; and dignified, understated emotion. Like most Netherlandish painters of his time, Bouts made his innovations through religious subjects, fromaltarpiecesto small devotional paintings that people kept in their homes. He was deeply influenced by Rogier van der Weyden, but where Rogier's portraits overwhelm with their beauty and expressive design, Bouts depicted Everyman. His style and investigations of new ways to establish depth in painting greatly influenced contemporary Netherlandish painters. His more homespun portraits and refreshing landscapes also appealed to artists at the end of the century." .

Like other enterprising photographers in the mid-1850s, he opened a studio on Broadway in New York City. Through flattery and determination, he lured notable subjects such as Daniel Webster and Henry Clay to his studio, which he promoted as a Hall of Fame. After the election of 1848, Brady traveled to Washington to photograph political figures. Over time, he built a monumental archive that included presidents, senators, congressmen, Supreme Court justices, actors, writers, businessmen, clergy, scientists, artists, military men, and entrepreneurs.At the outbreak of the Civil War, Brady obtained permission for his staff of photographers to follow in the tracks of the Union Army in the field. They worked under the direction of Alexander Gardner, who had managed Brady's Washington studio. Ruined by a series of financial setbacks, he spent his last years trying to sell his photographic archive to the American government, believing that it would assist future artists in representing their subjects with greater authenticity, enabling more compelling illusions, and making possible truly American pictures." .

His photographs of flowers, for a catalog titledFleurs photographiées,were to be transferred onto printing blocks for wallpaper and fabric designs. It was an extremely successful project for Braun; one album of the photographs was presented to Empress Eugénie of France, and it earned him a medal at the 1855 Paris Exposition Universelle.By the early 1860s, Braun's focus had shifted to the making of topographical views of scenes throughout Europe and, beginning in 1866, to reproductions of works of art. The reproduction of paintings, drawings, lithographs, engravings, and sculpture was an important endeavor in France, and photography provided an accurate record. Braun opened a photography studio that became one of the world's largest publishers of such images. In 1869 Braun's was one of only two photographic firms invited to photograph the opening of the Suez Canal in Egypt." .

He painted mostly religious and mythological scenes, along with portraits, landscapes, andgenrepictures. An active and accomplished draftsman, De Bray made architectural drawings and highly finished preliminary studies for paintings.De Bray's artistic development is not well documented. In 1635 he seemed to favor half-length figures, which at that time had become rather old-fashioned. By about 1640, his work showed the influence of Rembrandt van Rijn'schiaroscuro. In the following decade, De Bray began incorporatingclassicalcompositions into his work, a style introduced two decades earlier by fellow townsman Pieter de Grebber.De Bray played an important role in Haarlem's cultural projects and institutions. Unfortunately, many of his architectural designs were never carried out. He helped reorganize theGuildof Saint Luke in 1631, along with Pieter Molijn. Sensitive and intelligent, De Bray published a collection of love poems and a book on contemporary architecture.In 1663 - 1664, the plague struck the De Bray family, killing both parents and four of their ten children. The surviving sons Jan, Dirck, and Joseph became painters." .

At about age twenty, Breenbergh went to Rome, where he lived with Flemish landscapist Paul Brill and was influenced by the intimate, deeply poetic landscapes of German expatriate Adam Elsheimer. Breenbergh belonged to the first generation of Dutch Italianates, artists who traveled to Italy in the 1620s and were inspired by its light and atmosphere. With Cornelis van Poelenburgh, whose early style is very similar, Breenbergh helped to bring the Italianate tradition of landscape to the Low Countries, reflecting a fascination on the part of northern European artists with Italian landscapes rather than with the local topography.In Holland by 1633, Breenbergh specialized in scenes including Roman ruins, based on his drawings of Italy. In the 1630s he began introducing biblical and mythological figures and his compositions became larger and more ambitious. Breenbergh often painted Old Testament themes, but he placed the scenes themselves far in his landscape's background. His expressive figure types reveal affinities with those of Pieter Lastman. After 1645 he turned from landscape to narrative scenes and later painted portraits as well. By 1652 his productivity had dropped significantly; he may have become a merchant." .

As a journeyman in Austria from 1500 to 1502, Breu created three complex, multi-panelaltarpieces. Among the earliest works of the Danube School, they reflect an innovative interest in nature's moods and in depicting landscape for its own sake.In 1502 Breu settled in Augsburg, where he built a large workshop. Extremely versatile, he madehistory paintingsandfrescoesalong with designingwoodcutsand stained glass, usually with secular themes.Italianateornament andchiaroscuroeffects became increasingly apparent in his art, indicating that he probably traveled to Italy twice, once in about 1508 and again in 1514.During the turmoil of the Reformation, Breu's sympathy for iconoclasm did not prevent him from painting altarpieces in the 1520s. He also painted huge organ shutters depictingChristand the Virgin's ascensions to heaven for a chapel in Augsburg'sProtestantchurch. His late style incorporatedManneristelements such as violent gestures, turbulent folds of clothing, and strong colors. His son headed his workshop at his death." .

Trained as a painter, she turned to photography in 1902. \"[S]lim, hearty, unaffected women of early maturity living a hardy out-of-door life in high boots and jeans, toughened to wind and sun\" were Brigman's favored subjects, and she photographed them nude in the landscape of the Sierra Nevada mountains of Northern California.Brigman was one of two original California members of the art photography group thePhoto-Secession, founded by Alfred Stieglitz, and she was the only Western photographer to be made a Fellow of the group. Three issues ofCamera Workfeatured her photographs, and the BritishLinked Ringsociety of photographers elected her a member. Around 1929 she moved to Long Beach in Southern California, where she continued to photograph, focusing on a series of sand erosions. A year before her death in Eagle Rock, near Los Angeles, in 1950, she published a book of her poems and photographs titledSongs of a Pagan." .

The Briseis Painter takes his name from a vase now in London that depicts a moment from the legend of theTrojan War: Agamemnon taking the slave girl Briseis away from the hero Achilles, as described in the opening scene of Homer'sIliad.The Briseis Painter is one of several vase-painters who learned his trade in the workshop of the Brygos Painter, one of the most influential Athenian vase-painters of this period.The Briseis Painter specialized in the decoration of cups, although he also painted some large vessels." .

The question prompted Bristol to open a number of musty footlockers whose contents had been stowed away for decades. Inside were photographs that he had made half a century earlier while traveling through California's Central Valley with Steinbeck.In 1937 Bristol became one of the first staff photographers forLIFEmagazine. That winter, he and John Steinbeck traveled through California, interviewing and making photographs of migrants living in labor camps for a collaborative, book length project. Steinbeck later withdrew from their project, telling Bristol that he planned to write a novel. After Viking Press publishedThe Grapes of Wrathin 1939, Bristol's photographs of California workers appeared inLIFE.During World War II, Bristol was one of an elite team of naval photographers headed by Edward Steichen; after the war, Bristol went to Tokyo, Japan, and established the East-West Photo Agency. He and his family remained in Japan until the 1960s, after which they moved first to Mexico, then back to Southern California, where Bristol had spent much of his youth." .

Brockhurst entered the Royal Academy Schools in London, where he received the Gold Medal and Traveling Scholarship in 1913. The award allowed him to visit Paris and Italy, where he studied works by early Italian painters. Piero della Francesca and Leonardo da Vinci remained important influences. From 1915 to 1919, Brockhurst lived in Ireland, where he met painter Augustus John, whose painting style was influenced by contemporary French art's simplicity of color and forms. In 1919 Brockhurst returned to England for his first significant gallery exhibition. During the 1920s Brockhurst became an etcher, focusing primarily on female portraits and using his wife as his model. Coolness, technical perfection, and overt classicism mark both his printmaking style and his painting manner. By 1930 Brockhurst had returned to painting with a new teenage model, Dorette Woodard, whom he later married. His haunting portraits of her opened the door to fame and fortune, and he became a fashionable portrait painter; his stated goal was to capturing appearance, not character. His sitters included J. Paul Getty, Marlene Dietrich, and the Duchess of Windsor. In 1939, at the height of his success, Brockhurst settled in the United States." .

By about 1530 Bronzino had moved away from Pontormo's nervous sensibility and developed an art and career independent of his master. His new style was first evident in his portraits. For Bronzino, a portrait was a mask. Rather than revealing the sitter's character, the Florentine aimed to convey his subject's social standing, elegance, and restraint. Bronzino expressed the material world in his portraits; the enameled colors and attention to depicting details like his sitters' lace collars, hair, and jewelry, and even the veins in their hands gave his portraits a remote decorativeness.As court painter to Cosimo I de'Medici, first Grand Duke of Tuscany, Bronzino also painted religious works, which he approached with the same cool detachment as his portraits. Between  1546 and 1548, Bronzino lived in Rome. Hisallegoricalpaintings influenced younger Mannerist painters with their distorted poses, exaggerated expressions, and emphasis on movement. In his later work, Bronzino discarded his frozen passion, conceiving his public paintings as cumulative displays of his encyclopedic knowledge of art history and his talent for assimilating it into his own works, a notion that also typifiedMannerism." .

Scholars have attributed several portraits to this artist on the basis of a similar shape and proportions of head and neck; smooth shading around the eyes, nose and mouth; and the shape of the ears. Some of his portraits were excavated at Er-Rubayat in the Fayum.As with most ancient artists, the true name of the Brooklyn Painter is unknown and his work is identified only by stylistic traits. The Brooklyn Painter takes his name from the portrait of a man in the Brooklyn Museum." .

He worked in Fulda from about 1520 to 1545, painting portraits of distinguished local citizens and designing engravings andwoodcuts. Brownish flesh tones, green backgrounds, and an interest in fine materials characterized his portraits.By the time he moved to Erfurt around 1546, Brosamer, like many other struggling German painters, devoted himself exclusively to designs for both copper engravings and woodcuts. His woodcuts illustrated Martin Luther's WittenbergBibleand Luther's FrankfurtCatechism,both from 1550, and his engravings range from Christian, mythological, andclassicalthemes togenre scenes. Following NetherlandishManneristmodels, Brosamer depicted ambitious architectural backgrounds with groups of figures. He used very closely hatched lines to achieve the dense texture of his engravings." .

A pupil of sculptor Girolamo Ticciati, Bruschi worked in a Florentine Baroque style that appealed to the founder of the new Doccia porcelain factory, Marchese Carlo Ginori. In 1737 Ginori hired Bruschi to head the factory as his first chief modeler. Bruschi may have convinced Ginori to buy the molds of Florentine Baroque sculptors for re-use as molds for porcelain pieces. These molds supplied the style and forms that gave the small-scale Doccia porcelain statues their powerful, monumental quality. Bruschi's tenure at the factory coincided with the highest quality Doccia ware. The quality of the factory's production declined in 1757 with Ginori's death and fell further after Bruschi's death in 1778." .

After moving to the free city of Strasbourg, de Bry left for England in 1586. There he made some of his best-known works, engraved copies after scenes from the New World.While de Bry was in England, his family moved permanently to Frankfurt and set up a publishing business there. When he returned in 1589, he and his sons illustrated ten volumes of American travel literature with his New World engravings, published from 1590 to 1618. Most Europeans came to know the costumes and customs of the American Indians and the historical events of the New World through de Bry's prints, however distorted. He used European standards for landscape and figure types and, as a Lutheran, emphasized the cruelty of the Catholic Spanish conquerors toward the Peruvian natives. De Bry also published a series of engraved portraits of famous men. In addition to many book illustrations, he produced a large number of other prints, particularly designs for jewelry and goldsmith work." .

He specialized in cups, and over a dozen with his signature survive. Brygos had a long association with one vase-painter, the Brygos Painter, who is named after the potter. Almost all the cups signed by Brygos were decorated by the Brygos Painter or members of his workshop, like the Briseis Painter. Such a close and continued collaboration of potter and painter was unusual in the shifting workshops of the Athenian potters' quarter." .

Over two hundred vases have been attributed to him, including a limited number of shapes other than cups and some vessels in the white-ground technique. Having learned his craft from Onesimos, the Brygos Painter was himself quite influential and was the center of a large circle of painters. The Brygos Painter painted both genre and mythological scenes, being especially fond of depictions ofsymposia, athletes, and Achilles. His treatments of mythological scenes were often innovative, and he was also rather stylistically experimental. He had a greater interest in spatial effects and setting than did his contemporaries. By using dilute glazewashesto show three-dimensionality, his painting technique comes close to shading. As with most Greek vase-painters, the real name of the Brygos Painter is unknown, and he is identified only by the stylistic traits of his work. He is named after the potter Brygos, with whom he worked. Some scholars think the painter and potter may be one and the same person." .

His first job gave him exposure to some of the world's best news images. Soon, Burrows became a \"shooter\" in his own right, taking photographs of Winston Churchill, Ernest Hemingway and others.Burrows is best known for his nine years of work covering the Vietnam War. His photographs reveal the humanperspectivebehind the fighting, the precise angleLifewas looking for in their war coverage. Burrows often shot color film, while many of his counterparts used black and white exclusively. Color gave his images a greater sense of immediacy and a heightened reality.A three-time winner of the prestigious Robert Capa Award from the Overseas Press Club of America for his \"superlative photography requiring exceptional courage and enterprise,\" ironically, Burrows met the same fate as Capa. Like Capa 17 years earlier, in 1971 on his way to cover South Vietnam's expansion of the conflict into Laos, Burrows and four other photojournalists were killed when their helicopter crashed under enemy fire." .

Though the Bute Master often collaborated with other illuminators, as was common in the 1200s, he was solely responsible for all 190 historiated initials in the Bute Psalter. A prolific artist who worked in the prosperous cities in the border region between France and Flanders, the Bute Master is known for his distinctive historiated initials and decorative border extensions. These border extensions often served as supports for lively marginal figures engaged in a variety of activities.The Bute Master did his most inventive, finely finished work in a number of religious service books and devotional manuscripts, including the Bute Psalter. He also illuminated secular texts, mostly written in French, working in a simplified, linear style using thick black outlines." .

Although he had first worked as a porcelain painter at the rival porcelain manufactory of Chantilly, when he arrived at Sèvres in 1756, his superiors noted that he still needed to practice his craft. One remarked that Buteux painted \"figures, of which he understands very little, but wisely wants to perfect.\"Buteux experimented briefly in producing landscapes and animals. He found his true specialty, however, in painting trophies and attributes and was soon decorating vases and other vessels with over four hundred suchmotifsa year. For a service for Catherine II of Russia, Buteux decorated plates, serving dishes, cups, and saucers with 557 crowns andgildedinscriptions. He signed the pieces he decorated with an anchor." .

When he received his first important commissions in the early 1770s, he employed a lateBaroqueclassicist style inspired by Carlo Maratta. Around 1774, through his association with Johann Heinrich Fuseli's circle, he began adopting influences from Mannerist andRenaissancepainting, as well as theantique.Cades widened his range of subjects, which eventually included Greek and Roman literature, religious history, and Italian Renaissance literature. Although he remained in Rome throughout his career, He further expanded his artistic education by touring northern Italy. He worked on many decorative projects for Roman palazzi and villas and made easel paintings for churches and privatepatrons.In the 1780s, as his reputation grew, Cades became a fellow at the Accademia di San Luca, and his clients included Catherine the Great of Russia." .

As the nephew of Charles Le Brun, the chief designer and painter toLouis XIV, Caffieri had good connections as well as talent and rose quickly, becomingsculpteur et ciseleur ordinaire des bâtiments du roi(Sculptor, Bronze Caster and Chaser for the King's Palaces).In 1740, Caffieri's wife bought a royal privilege--a form of permit from the king--which allowed them to gild bronze as well as cast it within the same workshop; these two processes would usually have been done by separate businesses. After his son Philippe Caffieri joined the workshop in 1747, they produced designs for chandeliers, ornaments for coaches, wall lights, and furnituremounts. Jacques was a master of theRococostyle, using elaborate curves, flowering branches, and fantastical beasts in his creations. His notable clients included the queen, Marie Leczinska, the king's mistressMadame de Pompadour, and one of the daughters of Louis XV, Madame Elisabeth." .

His habit of making casts from his marble sculptures and giving them to institutions was fortuitous, for many of Caffieri's marbles were lost in a fire in 1761. Belonging to the third generation of a family of sculptors and bronzeworkers who had come from Italy in the previous century, Caffieri was the younger brother of bronzeworker Philippe Caffieri. Jean-Jacques won thePrix de Romein 1748 and spent four years in Rome studying ancient art. When he returned to Paris, he became sculptor toLouis XVand provided ornamental designs for metalwork, notably for the staircase at thePalais-Royal, a famous Parisian royal residence. He made his name, however, with a series of portrait busts of contemporaries likeMadame du Barryand famous dramatists of the past.Caffieri insisted on absolute fidelity to the model's features, and his talent lay in making these features come alive. He captured the kindness of astronomer Canon Pingre as well as the fierce countenance of Doctor Borie.

Under his direction, the Caffieri family workshop prospered, allowing him to become a wealthypatronof the arts. He invested in drawings and paintings by such artists as Rembrandt, François Boucher, and Jean-Baptiste Siméon Chardin.Philippe went into partnership with his father Jacques Caffieri in 1747 and then succeeded his father assculpteur-ciseleur ordinaire du roi(Sculptor and Bronze Caster to the King) in 1755. Unfortunately, as both father and son signed their worksCaffieri,scholars sometimes have difficulty distinguishing the early works of Philippe from those of his father.The Caffieris worked extensively for the French court, producinggiltbronze wall lights,firedogs, and clocks for the palaces ofVersaillesand Compiègne; Philippe also produced pieces for the royal court of Poland. Among his most important works was an altar set designed for thecathedralofNôtre-Damein Paris; this disappeared when the church was pillaged during theFrench Revolution. Most of Philippe's designs were produced in the heavy, earlyNeoclassicalstyle known asgoût grec." .

He worked in the Campanian style in Capua, one of the Greek colonies in South Italy. As with most Greek vase-painters, the real name of the Caivano Painter is unknown; he is named after the town where some of his work has been found. The Caivano Painter frequently represented unusual mythological and theatrical subjects. Warriors wearing local Oscan armor and women wearing dresses with dotted stripes down the middle often appear in his work. As well as the usual white and yellow, the Caivano Painter added purplish-red to his scenes to achieve a rich, colorful result.The Caivano Painter strongly influenced Paestan vase-painting, another South Italian regional style, and he may even have worked in Paestum." .

As a youth, he visited Italy with his father and must have received training in Florence, since his drawing style owes much to Tuscan artistic models. His earliest commissions were collaborations with his father.Cajés began working for Philip III in 1608, becoming painter to the king in 1612. For his first important work, he decorated a chapel in ToledoCathedral. His early works are characterized by the dramatic artificiality typical ofMannerism, while his mature works reflect a move towardnaturalism." .

Although he may have first studied painting in his native town, he moved to Rome after the death of his father in 1602 where he studied mosaic art with Marcello Provenzale. With the renewal of interest in Italian mosaics in the early 1600s, Provenzale worked as a restorer of ancient mosaics. He invited Calandra's collaboration on his projects in theVaticanand inSaint Peter's basilica. These were the first of Calandra's many projects for papal and royalpatrons, including members of the Aldobrandini, Ubaldini, and most importantly, Barberini families.Under the patronage of the Barberini, Calandra was commissioned to execute mosaics aftercartoonsin the Roman Church of Saints Peter and Paul by Giovanni Battista Ricci da Novara.  In 1629, Calandra, who had already worked on many Vatican projects, was named restorer of all the mosaic work in Saint Peter's. He also made mosaic copies of paintings and funerary portraits and restored Giotto'sChristWalking on the Waters,known as theNavicella,and the famous ancient Palestrina mosaic owned byCardinalBarberini." .

Inspired by a workshop and lecture given by Ansel Adams, he began to photograph in Detroit. In the early 1940s, he took time off from his job at General Motors to concentrate on his photography. Around that time he went to New York, where he met Berenice Abbott, Paul Strand, and Lisette Model.Callahan began teaching photography at the Institute of Design of the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago in 1946. Fifteen years later he founded the department of photography at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence. His work is largely Modernist in style, defined by its geometry and frequent abstraction of forms. He made a celebrated portrait series of his wife, Eleanor, which includes deeply personal studies of form and light. He explained the images simply by saying, \"There's some beauty you don't want gone.\"" .

For her, photography is another studio tool to be used, along with the sets she creates and the models she directs, to render the sensual tones and textures of fabric and food, or to animate clay figures of her own making. The persistent inventiveness of Callis's work has made her a force in Southern California art and in recent photographic practice.Callis began her art studies in Ohio in the 1950s, as a high school student in Cincinnati and in college at Ohio State University in Columbus. However, her academic work was interrupted by marriage, a move to Los Angeles, and child rearing. After taking several studio classes at night in an attempt to return to her education in painting and sculpture, she decided to enroll at UCLA and finish her undergraduate degree in the arts. She subsequently entered the graduate studio program. Her professor, Robert Heineken, encouraged her to experiment with photography in the studio, using her skills in the other arts to construct scenes for the camera. Callis began teaching at the California Institute of the Arts (Cal Arts) in 1976. A Los Angeles gallery show in 1981 paired Callis's color work with that of Paul Outerbridge. Her avant-garde style of fabricating photographs was subsequently recognized, and her work exhibited and published internationally." .

By 1608 he had apprenticed to engraver and publisher Philippe Thomassin, learning line engraving and copying Flemish art and lateManneristworks in Roman churches.Callot's career really began in Florence in 1612, however, when he began working for the sophisticated, hyper-elegantMedici court. With a Mannerist's flair for wit and incisive detail, Callot drew and etched fairs, festivals,commedia dell'artecharacters, beggars,courtiers, and hunchbacks. After Duke Cosimo II's death in 1621, Callot returned to Nancy, where he worked for the Lorraine court depicting fanciful scenes of daily life. Most of his painted decorations have been destroyed.In Nancy, Callot approached his work with a new directness and seriousness. He added poignant religious subjects, siege compositions, and sensitive landscape drawings and etchings to his repertoire. In 1633, inspired by the Thirty Years War and Cardinal Richelieu's invasion of Lorraine, Callot created a series of prints called theMiseries of War.His devastating appraisals of human cruelty and folly were a source for Francisco de Goya y Lucientes'sDisasters of Warnearly two hundred years later." .

He won the most important commissions of his day and supervised a large workshop of masters, apprentices, and pupils. Born to a furrier in Verona in 1549, he moved to Venice in 1572 to study with the sculptor Danese Cattaneo. After the death of his teacher, he took on Cattaneo's unfinished commissions, including several large public projects. In 1590, while working on commissions for the high altars of two major Venetian churches, Campagna began producing bronze sculpture for the first time. Campagna became so famous that an agent of the Duke of Urbino reported that he could pick and choose his projects and \"had to be handled with kid gloves.\" According to legend, when his commemorative marble statue of Duke Federigo da Montefeltro was criticized, he was outraged and wrote a public letter listing his major achievements. Campagna is particularly known for the dramatic, expressive style of his later work." .

After his father's death around 1516, Campagnola was Venice's foremost printmaker. He innovated bycuttingwoodblocks himself rather than employing a professional woodcutter. His earliest prints and drawings show the influence of German artist Albrecht Dürer. Campagnola's lush, flowing style and religious subject matter may also indicate access to Titian's workshop.By around 1520 Campagnola moved to Padua, where he became its busiest and most praised painter. Hisfrescoesand easel paintings for churches and palaces betray his Venetian origins with their asymmetrical compositions and rich treatment of fabrics. Nevertheless, he remained most celebrated for hiswoodcutsand landscape drawings, which he sold as finished compositions. He drew raised foregrounds set against poetic vistas of paths, castles, bridges, and ruins, with jagged peaks of distant mountains." .

According to Giorgio Vasari, Campi learned painting from his father, though his early creations were also indebted to Pordenone'sManneriststyle.Around 1539, Campi and his rival were both painting decorations in Cremona's church of San Sigismondo. In this competitive context, Campi created some of his most energetic works. Hisfrescoesandaltarpiecetypify an eclectic style combining Giulio Romano's monumentalclassicismwith the elegant, sensuality of Parmigianino, influences also displayed in his rival's nervously rhythmic frescoes. Together the two competitors designed and constructed decorations forEmperor Charles V's1541 triumphal entry into Cremona. When Campi returned to San Sigismondo in the late 1550s, his style showed a greater monumentality and more daringillusionism, suggesting a recent visit to Rome. In his last years he painted regularly for CremonaCathedral." .

Although his life in Tournai is well recorded, none of his documented works survives in adequate condition to serve as a basis for attributing other paintings to him. Scholars generally accept, however, that a number of paintings grouped as the work of the Master of Flémalle are Campin's. Nothing certain is known of his artistic training and background.From 1408 to 1441, the municipality frequently employed Campin for banners and other decorative ephemera, as well as decorations for government buildings and churches. Successful and wealthy, he was a deacon of the painters'guild, a leading spokesman for Tournai's bourgeoisie, and head of a sizeable workshop.Campin humanized subject matter, breaking with the aristocratic taste and romantic mood of the ornamentalInternational styleto portray the Annunciation taking place in a contemporary middle-class Tournai home. The sculptural solidity andnaturalisticdetail of his style show sculptor Claus Sluter's influence. Campin's influence, mediated through his pupil Rogier van der Weyden, was widespread." .

A Venetian native, Canaletto was first trained by his father, a theatrical scene painter. In 1719 he went to Rome for a year, possibly studying with Dutch and Italian painters ofclassicalruins. Canaletto's earliest datable works are four views of Venice from about 1725, unusual because they were painted directly on the site. He later returned to the traditional method of working from drawings and mastered thecamera obscuraas an aid. His early works show a poetic responsiveness to the light, atmosphere, and moods of Venice, along with an eye for strikingcompositionsthat stayed with him for life.After staying in England for ten years, Canaletto gave up his small Venetian views in 1756 and turned to grandeur and fantasy, broadening his subject matter to include views of Rome. He also evolved an increasingly linear, firm manner that suited his clients' demands for accuracy and was more readily taught to assistants. He provided numerous drawings for engravers. Except for his nephew Bernardo Bellotto, none of Canaletto's many pupils are known, but he was widely imitated in both Venice and England during his lifetime." .

Despite his lasting reputation as a champion of Neoclassicism, Canova's earliest works displayed a lateBaroqueorRococosensibility that was appealing to his firstpatrons, nobility from his native Venice. During his first and second visits to Rome in 1779 and 1781, Canova reached a turning point. He studied antiquities, visited the grand studios of the Roman restorers Bartolomeo Cavaceppi and Francesco Antonio Franzoni, and came under the influence of the English Neoclassicist Gavin Hamilton. In a competition organized by the Venetian aristocrat Don Abbondio Rezzonico, Canova produced his statuette ofApolloCrowning Himself,a work inspired by ancient art of a physically idealized and emotionally detached figure. This work came to define theNeoclassicalstyle. The success of the Apollo enabled the young sculptor to obtain a block of marble for his next work on a large scale,Theseusand the Minotaur,which established his reputation. From the moment of its completion, it was the talk of Rome. From then until his death, Canova's renown grew throughout Europe." .

He first trained in Bologna under Guido Reni, then with Guercino, whoseclassicalBaroquestyle remained an inspiration. From the early 1650s, Canuti worked in Rome, where he studied masterpieces by the Bolognese painter Annibale Carracci to learn the concepts of organizing large decorative schemes.Canuti spent the 1660s in Bologna, where he applied these lessons in extensivefrescodecorations in a major palazzo, achieving the illusion of vast aerial space amidst rhythmic areas of dark and light in a mythological apotheosis. After this success, Canuti returned to Rome in 1672 and completed his major Roman commission, a religious apotheosis. These decorations displayed his love of ornament and sensual profusion of fruits and flowers, which appealed more to Genoese than to Roman taste. Ironically, sketches for Canuti's projects demonstrate his habit of diverging from his original designs in his final paintings.After again returning to Bologna, Canuti employed Giuseppe Maria Crespi in his flourishing studio." .

Many of his images, taken under extremely dangerous conditions in the midst of ground combat, convey the chaos of battle in a way no photographer before had captured.One of Capa's most famous images,Death of a Spanish Loyalist,helped to define the genre of photojournalism as it has evolved in recent decades. Taken at the precise moment that the soldier was shot dead and falling backward, it conveys a sense of bravery on the part of the soldier, but also lets viewers understand that Capa was himself in harm's way. Capa's bravado led him to wade into the Atlantic Ocean off of Normandy, France along with D-Day troops in World War II. Under a hail of bullets from the German troops above the shore, Capa shot dozens of images from theperspectiveof the American invasion force. In a famous incident, much of Capa's film from that day was ruined when a lab technician placed the film in an overheated dryer, melting the emulsion.In 1947, Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Bill Vandivert, and several other photographers formed the cooperative photo agency, Magnum. Cartier-Bresson later said of Magnum's unique, almost artistic, photojournalistic philosophy: \"Life isn't made of stories that you can cut into slices like an apple pie. There's no standard way of approaching a story. We have to evoke a situation, a truth. This is the poetry of life's reality.\"Capa accompanied troops to Indochina in 1954. While there, he unknowingly walked across a land mine after straying from the main group, and died soon after." .

As apprentice to his brother, Carducho was steeped in theclassicalItalian tradition: his paintings featured careful drawing, smooth surfaces, andclassicizingcompositions. In 1609 Vicente succeeded his brother as royal painter, a position he kept for life. After Diego Velázquez arrived in 1623, however, Carducho and othercourt paintersoften found themselves overshadowed by the young genius.Carducho primarily painted religious subjects. In 1632 he completed Europe's most extended cycle of monastic paintings: fifty-six influential canvases illustrating the lives of Saint Bruno and other Carthusians for a Carthusianmonasterynear Segovia. Carducho may be most recognized for his contributions to Spanish art theory. HisDiálogos de la Pinturaof 1633 championed Michelangelo and the Italian classical tradition while defending painting as a noble pursuit. The artist, wrote Carducho, is a learnedhumanist, not just a craftsman; painters should uplift people morally. In attacking Caravaggio's new dramatic realism and its \"external copying of nature,\" Carducho called him a \"monster of genius and talent,\" \"Anti-Michelangelo\" and \"Anti-Christ.\"" .

Scholars considered him the first artist to have consciously emphasized the importance and grandeur of Venice by depicting it as a center of international activity. Carlevarijs began his career in 1703 with the monumental publication ofThe Buildings and Views of Venice Designed inPerspectiveand Engraved by Luca Carlevarijs.The illustrations of 104 views of Venice were, at the time, considered \"the most complete survey of the fabric of the city ever produced.\" Because the publication was considered by many as patriotic, Carlevarijs won favor and patronage from the residents of Venice. Carlevarijs documented many diplomatic scenes such as the arrival of dignitaries to Venice, who were customarily greeted with elaborate celebrations in their honor. The paintings were then given to the dignitaries to take home, where they would serve as a type of advertisement for the dramatic and lavish city. Although large pageant paintings were Carlevarijs's most notable commissions, he also made dynamic drawings and oil sketches of everyday Venetian life, conveying the vivacity of a busy city." .

He settled there with other German andFlemishcraftsmen and took employment in the workshop of Jean-François Oeben, whose sister he married. Inventories made after Carlin's death show that theébénisteand his wife lived modestly in a five-room apartment in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, an unfashionable quarter of Paris, with simple furniture, a fewpastelportraits, and a blacklacquerclock. Few of Carlin's wealthy clientele would have cared to venture into this area, and Carlin thus sold his works exclusively to middlemen such as themarchands-merciersSimon-Philippe Poirier and Dominique Daguerre.Carlin was particularly known for his furniture decorated with Sèvresporcelainplaques, which he began to make in 1765, following designs supplied by the dealer Poirier. Although he made a certain number of larger pieces,secrétaires,tables, and commodes, Carlin's most popular works were small, portable, and extremely elegant items such as small tables, music stands, and jewel cabinets. A master of theNeoclassicalstyle, he also produced works set with lacquer panels andveneersof mahogany." .

In an artistic culture dominated by Italian painters, Caron was one of a small number of native painters working in France during the late 1500s and early 1600s.By the age of twenty, Caron was painting decorative scenes alongside Italian painters at the château ofFontainebleaufor the king of France. Adopting theManneriststyle of Fontainebleau, he used unnatural color and exaggerated poses for figures; his similarly farfetched subjects includedallegoriesof the French court, violent massacres, and fantasy and magic. Caron's contemporaries admired his drawings, and numerous printmakers reproduced them during his lifetime. He was even commissioned to make a series of paintings glorifying the widowhood of QueenCatherine de' Medici; the drawings were later used as tapestry designs. During his lengthy career, Caron also designed the decorations for many French court festivals and marriage ceremonies." .

Britain and Brittany were transformed into the canal city in one of his most famous cycles,The Legend ofSaint Ursula,commissioned by Venice'sScuolaof Saint Ursula, a fraternity of merchants and craftsmen, for their meeting hall adjacent to a Dominican church. When he completed the cycle in 1498, Venetians delighted in the pageantlike scenes of familiar sights: dogs and pet monkeys, lounging cavaliers, flying flags, and bustling activity everywhere. A native of Venice, Carpaccio was born into a family of fishermen and boat builders. He was probably a student of Gentile Bellini, a Venetian painter of incident-fillednarratives, and assistant to Gentile's brother Giovanni, but Carpaccio ultimately developed his own fanciful storytelling style. Though he painted religious works and secular panel paintings, his main vocation comprised huge, narrative canvases for the Venetianscuole,whose tastes for richly colored panoramas celebrating the city's success perfectly matched his talents. By tapping into the conservative patronage in Venice, Carpaccio continued painting until his death, virtually impervious to the new doctrines of painting introduced by such artists as Titian." .

Ten years later he entered theÉcole des Beaux-Arts, where he studied with theRomanticsculptor François Rude. He won thePrix de Romein 1854 and traveled to Italy, where he copiedantiquestatues and was greatly influenced by Michelangelo and otherRenaissancesculptors. By emphasizing extreme emotional and physical states in contrast to the calm,classicalcomposure encouraged by theAcadémie, Carpeaux'sUgolinoof 1860 broke with prevailing formulas and laid the foundation for his reputation as the leading sculptor of the day. Returning to Paris in 1862, Carpeaux executed numerous portraitbustsand became the favored portrait sculptor ofNapoleon IIIand his court. His sensitive portraits combined anatomical and psychologicalrealismwith a lyricism reflecting theRococorevival that permeated much of the period's sculpture. His use of deep shadow and emphasis onchiaroscuroinfluenced later sculptors, including Auguste Rodin. Carpeaux also worked as a painter." .

As with most vase-painters, the real name of the Carpenter Painter is unknown. His name comes from his depiction of a carpenter at work on a cup now in London in the British Museum. Details of the figures in his pictures-such as the way he drew clavicles, pectorals, nipples, turned down corners of the mouth, long slender hands, and garment folds-identify his work. Although few works by this vase-painter have been identified, it appears that he painted primarily cups.

These masters, and their superior manner of painting, were the reason that many youths were . . . dedicating themselves to the same profession,\" a contemporary wrote about theAccademia degli Incamminati(Academy of the Progressives) that Lodovico Carracci and his cousins founded in Bologna.Lodovico was older than his cousins, the brothers Annibale and Agostino Carracci, and he may have led the way in their quest to shift painting away from Mannerism's artifice. They trained most of the next generation's major Bolognese painters, including Domenichino and Guercino, to draw from life and to emphasize realistic, solid form. The leastclassicalof the three, Lodovico's own influence on the younger generation was significant. Guercino in particular seized on Lodovico's emotionalism, his decorative patterns, rich textures, and hispainterlyBaroqueapproach to color and light. The mystery of Lodovico's devotional works and the aristocratic sentiment of his portraits were unmatched by either cousin. After Agostino and Annibale left Bologna in the mid-1590s, Lodovico ran the Academy alone. Without their stimulation, he declined into a painter of large, rather sentimentalaltarpieces." .

When Agostino, his brother Annibale, and their cousin Lodovico sat down to meals, they held bread in one hand and charcoal in the other. As often as not, they poked fun at each other and people on the street. Thus, truecaricaturedeveloped; an early example can be traced directly to Agostino.In 1582, the Carracci founded theAccademia degli Incamminati(Academy of the Progressives), which began as an informal gathering of artists. By 1585, it was the most popular teaching academy in Bologna and a rallying point for progressive artistic tendencies. In reaction to theManneristdistortion of anatomy and space, the Carracci emphasized drawing from life. Agostino was principally an engraver as well as a gifted teacher. His systematic drawings studying the parts of the human body were engraved after his death and became important teaching tools for the next two hundred years. In 1597, Agostino joined Annibale in Rome to work on the monumental Farnese Galleryfrescoes. Three years later, after a falling out, Agostino left for another Farnese family project in Parma, where he died prematurely in 1602." .

A tailor's son, Carracci considered himself a craftsman, not acourtier, but the Romans buried him in the Pantheon beside Raphael.Along with his older brother Agostino and his cousin Lodovico, Annibale founded the Accademia degli Incamminati (Academy of the Progressives) in Bologna, which focused onnaturalismand rejectedMannerism. There they revived the practice of working from life, focusing on the craft of art rather than the elegant life ofcourt painters. The Carracci were tireless observers. Scholars credit Annibale with teachingcaricatureand helping to revive the process of creating extensive preparatory drawings for paintings.Between 1597 and 1601, Carracci worked on the gallery ceiling of the Palazzo Farnese in Rome, his most important legacy. Conceiving the ceiling as open to the sky, he painted its mythological love scenes as framed easel pictures within anillusionisticframework. After receiving a paltry five hundredlirefor this extensive decoration, he suffered a breakdown. A prolific draftsman, Carracci derived his heroic figure style from antique sculpture and Michelangelo and Raphael's art, but he added a richness and buoyancy from his copious studies from life. He originated the \"ideal landscape,\" with figures, buildings, and nature in perfect balance, a nature tamed and ennobled by man's presence." .

By 1634, he was an independent artist receiving numerous commissions, mainly from the church to paintaltarpieces. His earliest work reveals both Italian andFlemishinfluences, especially from the works of Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, and Titian. In 1658 Carreño was hired as an assistant on a royal commission to paintfrescoesin the Alcázar palace. There he met the painter Francisco Rizi, with whom he frequently collaborated thereafter. Carreño became increasingly favored in the royal circle. In 1671 he was appointedcourt painterto the queen and began to paint primarily portraits." .

In 1840 Pierre-Jean David d'Angers sponsored him for theÉcole des Beaux-Arts. He stayed only briefly, moving to the Petite École to study decorative arts instead. Between 1850 and 1855, Carrier-Belleuse worked in England, designing ceramics and metalwork models for companies like Wedgwood. From 1857 he exhibited large-scale sculptures at theSalon, where he garnered medals and commissions from importantpatrons. Emperor Napoléon III employed him in public projects during the massive rebuilding of Paris from 1851 to 1870.Carrier-Belleuse had a sharp sense of how to combine historical elements with new technologies and the process ofmassproduction. In his workshop, students like Auguste Rodin learned the value of series, editions, and variations made alongside unique, monumental Salon submissions.His work encompassed all manner of sculptural subjects and materials, and hisnaturalismincorporated a breadth of styles: unembellishedRealism, neo-Baroque exuberance, andRococoelegance. He consistently opposed, however, the static poses and idealizing tendencies ofNeoclassicism. Historchèresfor the Paris Opéra were typical: he combined figures inspired by sixteenth-century sculptors with electrotyping, a new process for replicating three-dimensional objects. Beginning in 1876 Carrier-Belleuse revitalized the Sèvresporcelainmanufactory as its artistic director." .

Her subjects focused on the everyday activities of women and mythological themes connected with women's lives.After painting a pastel portrait of the printmaker Antonio Maria Zanetti, for which she achieved considerable fame, Carriera received commissions from England's influential ambassador in Venice, Christian Cole, first duke of Manchester. Carriera was admitted to the Accademia di San Luca in Rome in 1705. As her career progressed, Carriera's luminous pastel portraits took on a more personal style. Subtly blended colors and an interest in rendering the sitter's inner psychology gradually began to characterize her work.While the guest of French banker Pierre Crozat in Paris, she created portraits of Louis XV as a child and other members of the French aristocracy and court. While there, she developed a friendship with Antoine Watteau, who had a significant impact on her work. She, in turn, had a formative influence on Maurice-Quentin Delatour, Jean-Etienne Liotard, and other important pastel painters. King George III collected her works, and Frederick-Augustus II, elector of Saxony, filled a room in his Dresden palace with more than one hundred of her pastels." .

His fractured early family life and a perpetual afflication with self-doubt may have contributed to his original expressions of mood.Carriès grew up in an orphanage after the age of six. He began his artistic education creating religious images in a sculptor's studio at thirteen. In 1874 he joined theÉcole des Beaux-Artsin Paris as a probationary pupil, but his irregular attendance resulted in failing the admission tests. Nevertheless, he made hisSalondebut the following year. His sculpture was well received; hisallegoricalheads depicting particular emotions and states of mind, named \"the hopeless,\" \"the disinherited,\" and \"the strays\" by a contemporary poet, especially earned praise from the art critics. Working mostly in bronze, he also created historical representations, portraits of contemporaries, and heads of babies.In 1889 Carriès retreated to the Loire Valley to devote himself to his life-long interest in ceramics. Setting up his own factory, he embarked on his most ambitious project: a monumental Symbolist doorway commissioned by a princess for the room in which she kept her treasured manuscript of Richard Wagner's operaParsifal." .

Tragically, Castello died suddenly at the height of a brilliant career.By passionately studying a vast range of sources, Castello formed a unique, sophisticated artistic style. Born to a family of painters, the young artist copied drawings in his late father's studio and studied works by painters known for their emotional power and vivid colors. Feeling confined by his local teachers' interest innaturalismandnarrative, Castello left for Milan and Parma. There, he scrutinized works by artists who bent nature in the service of expressiveness.Patronsadmired Castello's paintings of mythological and religious subjects as well as his lively oil sketches. His livelyfrescoesof glowing color and dramaticillusionismin various Genoese palaces made him most famous.

He first studied with local artists in his native Genoa, absorbing not only TuscanMannerismand Caravaggism but also the style of Peter Paul Rubens, who had worked in Genoa. From 1621 Castiglione also worked in Anthony van Dyck's Genoa studio. Early on, he was attracted toFlemishanimal painting. Though he painted portraits, historical pieces, and landscapes, Castiglione excelled in rural scenes with animals and influenced Italy's animal painting specialists.By 1634 Castiglione was in Rome, where he remained for about ten years. After returning to Genoa for a time, he worked for the Mantuan court in 1648, which had also employed Rubens. There Castiglione picked up the freedom of touch he saw in Domenico Fetti's paintings. One of the first Italians to appreciate Rembrandt van Rijn's etchings, Castiglione probably invented the monotype. Also admired for his fluent brush drawings in oil on paper, Castiglione influenced artists throughout Europe and virtually every Italian printmaker who followed. Despite his easygoing nature, his last works were intense, ecstaticcompositions, reminiscent of Gian Lorenzo Bernini's contemporary style." .

Documents establish the boundaries of his career as 1611 and 1650. Scholars also know that he was related by marriage to painter Alonso Cano, his Sevillan peer, and to Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, who became Castillo's apprentice. His Sevillan predecessors influenced Castillo's warmpalette. Thenaturalismthat distinguished his manner derived from the Venetian paintings that were relatively abundant in Seville.Castillo's most important commission was a series of paintings for thealtarpieceof a convent in Seville, beginning in 1636. Taddeo Zuccaro's painting of the same subject inspired his composition for the central panel of theAssumption of the Virgin, but Castillo derived the movement and theatricality of some figures from Peter Paul Rubens's style. Castillo's carefully painted landscape backgrounds establish him as one of Seville's key contributors to that tradition during the 1600s. He influenced the highly renowned Bartolomé Estebán Murillo in both naturalism and figure style." .

Born in Córdoba, he received his early training with his father and later studied with a painter of religious figures. By 1638 Castillo was described as a master painter. He specialized in religious works infrescoand oil on canvas. Many of his paintings still can be seen in and around Córdoba, particularly in the city'scathedral. In the solidity and weight of his figure modeling, Castillo displayed the influence of Sevillan painter Francisco de Zurbarán, while Bartolomé Estebán Murillo's style contributed to his preference for muted tones. Castillo was a prolific draftsman, with a characteristic style of vigorous strokes in quill pen andsepiaink and in red chalk. His peers admired and collected his drawings during his lifetime. Artists and students, who regularly copied Castillo's carefully finished drawings, also studied his technique. In subject matter, his countryside scenes and studies of animals were unique in Spanish Baroque draftsmanship. He often signed sheets with the interlaced monogramAC." .

He began as a flower painter at Vincennes and rose to become head of the painters workshop when the manufactory moved to Sèvres. At first, he only painted flowers and cherubs, but eventually he was allowed to produce an increasingly wide range of subjects, including mythological, historical, and military scenes--even a picture of George Washington.The factory archives note that in 1755 Caton was \"five feet, two inches high, thin, but with a good physique, blue eyes, with blonde hair.\" He married another flower painter, and one of their sons also worked for Sèvres." .

Cavaceppi trained as a sculptor and entered the Accademia di San Luca in 1732. In 1734CardinalAlbani, the nephew of Pope Clement XI and the most ambitious and learned private collector of antiquities in Rome, appointed Cavaceppi as his restorer. The relationship with the cardinal brought Cavaceppi many commissions from foreign tourists, particularly from British collectors who wanted to set up galleries back home. For these and otherpatrons, he not only foundantiquestatues, restored them, or made copies but also created original worksall'antica,in the antique style. Cavaceppi rarely signed his work; while some of his statues were known to be his own original designs, others were confused with authentic antiquities.Cavaceppi also worked as a restorer for the pope at the Museo Clementino. His fame was firmly established between 1768 and 1772, when he published three volumes of engraved images of works he had restored or possessed, theRaccolta d'antiche statue, busti, teste cognite." .

Despite his easily recognized individual style, little is known about Cavallino himself. Born in Naples, he probably died there during the plague of 1656. He worked for art dealers and privatepatronswhose records no longer exist. Only eight signed or initialed paintings are extant; four drawings have been attributed to him. During his lifetime, his pictures may have been sold outside Naples, often under other artists' names.Cavallino specialized in relatively small paintings of saints and subjects from theOld Testament,New Testament, and Roman mythology on canvas and copper. He was probably trained in Naples, in an academic tradition emphasizing figure drawing, architecture,perspective, and literary sources. His paintings can be theatrical, with subtle, intense coloring; anaturalisticrendering of surfaces; mannered elegance and grace; and an emotional tenderness unparalleled in his Neapolitan peers." .

Emulating Caravaggio's commitment to realism and use of dramatic contrasts of light and shade, Cavarozzi developed his own variation of \"Caravaggism.\"Cavarozzi spent his formative years in Rome. He lived with an aristocratic family, in their home near the Pantheon, and studied at an art academy. During this period, he came into contact with the painter, Cristoforo Roncalli. Cavarozzi's earliest known paintings show Roncalli's influence and suggest that he may have trained with him. But by around 1610, Cavarozzi had come under the influence of Caravaggio, many of whose paintings could be seen in Rome.In 1617, Cavarozzi traveled to Madrid. The works he executed in Spain display the substantial, naturalistic figures and use of raking light and darkness found in Caravaggio's work. Yet Cavarozzi developed his own distinctive style. He avoided the overtly dramatic presentation of many of Caravaggio's followers, instead favoring more tender, restrained figures. He returned to Rome in 1618 and died in 1625 at the age of about thirty-five." .

He was repeatedly prosecuted for sodomy, theft, and murder. Despite his notoriety, Cellini worked continuously for such augustpatronsas the popes in Rome, theMediciin Florence, and KingFrançois Iof France. Cellini was born in Florence in 1500. Although his father, a well-educated, middle-class carpenter, wanted him to become a musician, Cellini began training as a goldsmith at the age of thirteen. Over the following few years, he worked with a variety of masters, studiedantiquesculpture, and began designing large-scale sculptural projects. At the royal residence inFontainebleau, France, where François I imported numerous Italian artists in an effort to promote an artisticRenaissancein France, Cellini's sculptural projects reached their most ambitious heights. In the last years of his life and after another period of imprisonment, Cellini turned to writing his autobiography and treatises on goldsmithing and sculpture. In 1558 he took religious orders but later renounced them. He was one of the most prominent and respected ItalianManneristartists of the 1500s." .

In 1369 he was registered in Florence's Arte dei Medici e Speziali, and his only signed work is afrescoof 1410 from a church in Volterra, Italy. By examining dated artworks with similar characteristics, however, scholars have pieced together his probable career. His body of work seems to have been quite large, and he worked for some of the most powerful families and institutions in Florence. Cenni's use of golden backgrounds, flattened space, and elongated figures with elegant features exemplifies the InternationalGothicstyle in Florence. Cenni's gothicizing concept of form and lively colors may have been influenced by experience as a manuscriptilluminator." .

In the mid-1590s he went to Rome, where he adopted certain pink and yellow tones, most likely after having seen Federico Barocci's paintings. He established himself in Milan by the late 1590s, where his manypatronsincluded the Borromeo family.Cerano's paintings representing Saint Charles Borromeo's life, completed in 1604, are still displayed in MilanCathedralon the saint'sfeast day. Considered among his greatest achievements, these sumptuously colored and sensitively patterned scenes display a highly emotional, somewhat mystical tone. Influenced by a local tradition of religious intensity and popular devotion, Cerano humanized religious experience in his art. For Saint Charles Borromeo's canonization ceremony atSaint Peter's basilicain Rome in 1610, Cerano produced banners, embroidery designs for vestments and altar frontals, and six paintings depicting the saint's miracles. These Roman works presented simpler, more balanced and symmetricalcompositionsand larger, less contorted figures, possibly reflecting contact with Giulio Cesare Procaccini's art." .

What is clear is his style: a characteristic, lifelong synthesis of Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael's art. Equally apparent is this itinerant painter's importance: he spread the new artistic ideas of the HighRenaissance, transmitting elements of Raphael's style to northern Italy and aspects of Leonardo to Italy's southern regions.Cesare was originally from Lombardy; little is known about his education. As early as 1506, he may have been in Rome, working with Baldassare Peruzzi and probably coming into contact with the young Raphael. After his years in Rome, Cesare probably spent time in Milan. His paintings from this period display his characteristic marriage of Leonardo's means of expression and theme with Raphael's articulation of human form.By 1514 Cesare had left Milan, traveling south, probably through Rome, Florence, and Siena, then settling in Naples and Messina. There his paintings influenced local artists learning the High Renaissance style. After six years in southern Italy, Cesare returned to Milan, where he had a workshop and received commissions until his death." .

Emphasizing clarity and impact, Cesi's paintings reflect the Counter-Reformation interest in instruction. Born into affluence, the young Cesi studied under Nosadella. In the 1570s, while decorating the apse and crypt of the BolognaCathedral, Cesi absorbed strict Counter-Reformation beliefs from thecardinalwho coordinated the project. Promoting art solely as a vehicle for renewing faith and promoting Roman Catholic teachings, this cardinal later wrote that painted nudes were unsuitable for private houses and churches. In a 1585Crucifixionwith Saintsfor an altar in a Bolognese church, Cesi displayed his mature style: sober mood and intellectual, abstractcomposition, combined withnaturalisticfigures. These figures derive from life drawings that the indefatigable draftsman made for his paintings. Along with his contemporary Lodovico Carracci, Cesi successfully campaigned for a separate painters'guildin Bologna in 1599. Cesi's later years were less productive, but he became the drawing master of the Accademia degli Ardenti in 1620." .

For his specialized work painting cherubs, children, and rustic or pastoral scenes he never earned more than fifty-fourlivres--a low wage compared to what other painters at the factory received. Around 1782, his range of subject matter broadened to includefriezes, arabesques, and flowers. He also applied hatching and painted ground colors, two quite menial tasks. Five years later, perhaps discouraged by his small salary, he left the factory and set himself up as a grocer in the village of Sèvres." .

Seven years later, after commissions fromCardinalRichelieu, King Louis XIII, and the queen mother Marie de Médicis, Champaigne was appointed royal painter to the queen mother. He received numerous commissions for royal portraits, religious paintings for Parisian churches and for individual devotion, and decorative projects for royal residences. His prominence put him among the founding members of theAcadémie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, where he became a professor in 1653. A brilliant color sense, monumental conception of the figure, and sober use ofcompositioncharacterized Champaigne's religious works and his memorable psychological portraits. Peter Paul Rubens and Simon Vouet influenced his use of strong colors, but the ascetic Champaigne scorned these artists' decorative qualities. Both his contemporaries and modern scholars have attributed the severe plainness of his portraits to his Jansenist beliefs. His religious convictions also affected his choice of subjects: during the last decade of his career, he chose to paint only his family and friends and religious themes." .

The prince was only one of several aristocrats who established factories in France and Germany in the eighteenth century, searching for the elusive recipe for true porcelain like that produced in China and Japan. The factory's early production consisted of pieces painted in imitation of Japanese ceramics, probably copied directly from the prince's substantial collection. Other designs adapted simplified Eastern motifs, often inaccurately, to create brightly colored, richly patterned works.Chantilly's early works were made from soft-paste porcelain covered with an opaque tin glaze that produced a lustrous background for the painted decoration in enamel colors. The manufactory specialized in delicately modeled jugs, tureens, plates, teapots, and cups and saucers shaped like leaves. They also produced more fanciful designs, such as bald smiling Chinese figures, sometimes squatting beside vases that serve as potpourri or perfume burners. After the prince's death in 1740 removed the factory's chief financial support, Chantilly's fortunes began to waver; as a result, the wares became less innovative." .

The manufactory first hired Chapelle as an earthenware modeler and sculptor in 1745. Chapelle occasionally left to work in other manufactories, including those in Vincennes and Strasbourg. In 1748 he became co-owner and director of the Sceaux manufactory, eventually becoming sole owner in 1759. He leased the Sceaux enterprise in 1763 and returned to Rue de Charenton, where he became a partner with Mignon. Ten years later, Chapelle took advantage of a prolonged absence by Mignon to reorganize the factory, building a new kiln and changing formulas and designs. Mignon sued him in court and won, forcing Chapelle to hand over the management of the factory." .

His work was \"discovered\" in 1728 by Nicolas de Largillière at an outdoor show, and Chardin was immediately admitted for membership in theAcadémie Royale. Early in his career, Chardin painted primarily still lifes; he turned togenrepainting from 1733 to 1751, then created still lifes again after 1751. As his sight dimmed, he took uppastels, with which he made beautiful portraits. For most of his life, Chardin's entries in theSalonexhibitions were outstandingly successful. He helped to elevate still life to a respected category of painting, and his name remains inextricably associated with it. \"We have learned from Chardin that a pear is as living as a woman, that an ordinary piece of pottery is as beautiful as a precious stone,\" wrote novelist Marcel Proust." .

After a brief return to his native France and a tour of the United States, he set off on his first expeditionary sojourn in 1857 to Mexico, where he photographed pre-Columbian ruins. In 1863 he spent three months on the island of Madagascar off the southeastern coast of Africa as a writer and photographer for a French imperialist expedition. Although the expedition was unsuccessful, in 1864 Charnay published his account of that journey with engraved illustrations based on his photographs. He returned to Mexico that year and later traveled to South America, Indonesia, and Australia, conducting archaeological investigations and making architectural and anthropological photographs of native populations." .

Before he was seventeen, Théodore Chassériau won a third-class medal at theSalon. His early female nudes combined his characteristic sensuality with Ingres's idealizing style.In 1840 Chassériau joined Ingres in Rome. Increasingly critical of the academic curriculum, Chassériau became interested in theRomanticart of Ingres's nemesis, Eugène Delacroix. As Chassériau recounted the break, \"In a long conversation with M. Ingres, I saw that on many issues we could never have a meeting of minds.\" In response, Igres announced, \"Never speak to me again of that child!\"Back in Paris, Chassériau undertook decorations for churches and other public buildings; most are now poorly preserved. Recalling the ItalianRenaissance, Chassériau attempted to show great things like majesty and sublimity, dreaminess and melancholy. His decorations later influenced Gustave Moreau's Symbolist style.In 1846 Chassériau followed in Delacroix's footsteps by traveling to Algeria, where he made detailed drawings on which he based his late Orientalist canvases. A prolific draftsman, Chassériau drew portraits in lead pencil, as had Ingres. He also made prints after his paintings and etchings illustrating Shakespeare'sOthello." .

He began his career as a student at theÉcole des Beaux-Artsin his native Lyon, where he studied copperplate engraving. He then lived in Paris, where he worked for twelve years and became acquainted with artists who would influence his preference for religious and spiritual subjects. By 1862 Chatigny had returned to Lyon; four years later he had his public debut at theSalonin Lyon, submitting several paintings. After that he received many commissions for religious paintings in churches in Lyon and other French cities and continued to exhibit at the Salons in both Lyon and Paris until his death.Chatigny's sculptural work consists primarily of portraitmedallionsandbustsof his contemporaries. He often chose symbolic, mystical images that reflect his preoccupation with theRomanticthemes of death, the struggle of the spirit, and the sublime." .

He was active during the 1850s, when heated debates regarding the role of photography in the fine arts often occurred. The enthusiasm of those who felt that photography belonged among the fine arts spurred a market for photographic studies like Chauvassaigne's, which featured models posed in a studio setting similar to that of a painting. The compositional skill and aesthetic concern demonstrated in Chauvassaigne's work surpasses mere documentation and testifies to photography's place within fine art." .

Polychromy and extremely precise drawing, even on aminiaturescale, distinguish the vases produced by this group.Mythological scenes decorate many vases by the Chigi Group, in contrast to the animal decorations that were the popular style of Corinthian pottery in the 600s B.C." .

He specialized in the decoration of plates and bowls but also worked on the occasionalpyxis. The Chimaera Painter was the chief vase-painter of a larger group of artists called the Chimaera Group, over which he was very influential. Significantly, scholars can trace the path of his artistic training, which furnishes valuable information about workshop organization in ancient Corinth. He was a student of the Columbus Painter, who was in turn a student of the Painter of Palermo 489. The work of the Chimaera Painter is characterized by his carefully drawn and heavily incised figures, his symmetrical compositions, and his extensive use of added color.As with most vase-painters, the real name of the Chimaera Painter is unknown, and he is identified only by the stylistic traits of his work. He is named for his depiction of a chimaera, a mythological creature that combines features of a lion, a goat, and a snake, on a plate now in Vienna." .

Whether this legend is true or not, it speaks to the qualities of intimacy, delicacy, and refinement for which Chinard's work was so admired. He received his first formal training at a free, government-supported art school in Lyon and later studied in a workshop. From 1784 to 1787 he worked in Rome, sending back to Lyon copies ofantiqueworks to fulfill commissions from the local bourgeoisie and nobility. During this period, he won the first prize in sculpture from the Accademia di San Luca, a rare accomplishment for a foreigner.Despite several run-ins with Italian Church authorities for seemingly inappropriate and subversiveFrench Revolutionaryimagery in his sculptures, Chinard continued to travel back and forth between Lyon and Italy. Although one of the most popular French Empire sculptors and one of the favorite sculptors of Emperor Napoleon's family, Chinard made only three trips to Paris. He preferred living a provincial life; nevertheless, his patrons appreciated the sophisticated elegance and charm he gave to hisNeoclassicalportraitbusts." .

Living away from the South enables him to respond viscerally--through paintings, drawings, sculpture, and photography--to sites of deep meaning for him. Although Christenberry has long worked in a variety of media, he became known in the early 1970s as a pioneer of fine art color photography, somewhat ironically through small, straightforward snapshots of his subjects. In recent decades, Christenberry's art has consisted of large-format photographs of the same vernacular structures, as well as sculptures that resemble architectural models but are influenced by memory and association more than exacting observation. A large body of his work focuses on the Klu Klux Klan, a part of southern culture he abhors but feels cannot be ignored.Christenberry grew up in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but each summer stayed on the farms of his grandparents in rural Hale County. In the late 1950s, he earned undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa. The initial color photographs he made--with a Brownie camera he received as a child--were made as visual reference for the subjects he wanted to paint. In 1960, he had a life-changing experience: he encountered the bookLet Us Now Praise Famous Menand realized that his grandparents had known the poor sharecropper families whose lives were documented in it. Initially inspired by James Agee's writing and Walker Evans's portraits, Christenberry sought out Evans in New York City in 1961. Evans, who then worked as senior editor atFortune Magazine, helped him get a job atTime-Life. They became close friends until Evans's death in 1975. \"He was the first one to encourage me to take the photographs, the little Brownie snapshots, seriously,\" Christenberry has said of Evans. From 1962 to 1968, Christenberry taught photography at Memphis State University, after which he obtained a teaching position at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington DC. He began using a large format camera in the late 1970s, which has enabled him, year after year, decade after decade, to record the effects of time's passage on his beloved South." .

He always worked in Venice, but he maintained close links with his hometown. The local countryside appears in many of the backgrounds of his painting, and its villages were important sources of his patronage.Cima probably arrived in Venice by the mid-1480s. Exactly where he trained is uncertain, but Giovanni Bellini's art influenced him early and for life. Cima changed his style little during his career. His pictures feature a refined sense of surface detail, statuesque figures, and a calm, meditative mood. Sharply directed light defines crisp landscapes and architectural settings. Cima repeated heads, figures, and landscapemotifsin many paintings, yet each picture was the product of numerous preparatory drawings.By the 1490s, when Bellini was decorating the Doge's Palace, Cima became Venice's leadingaltarpiecepainter. Along withaltarpieces, his large workshop produced numerous half-length paintings of the Virgin and Child. He also painted a few mythological subjects, all apparently decorations forcassonior other furniture." .

Before his worksVenus de' Mediciand theDancing Faunwere first published in 1998, together with a number of other bronzes cast for the Earl of Macclesfield, the artist was little known, although several documents about his activity had been previously published. Notably, in 1709 Cipriani assisted his teacher, Massimiliano Soldani Benzi (1656-1740) in casting four figures for the Duke of Marlborough's collection at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. These works were inspired by ancient sculptures that had been on display in the Uffizi collection in Rome since the second half of the 1600s.Historical records also show Cipriani supplying plaster casts to a variety of British tourists, including the noted writer Horace Walpole. Walpole was one of Cipriani's last customers, and made note of the artist's death in his correspondence.Cipriani's work is significant in the history of collecting in 18th-century England. In the case of the Getty Museum's two particular bronzes, it was also carried out with the utmost attention to detail, as it was specifically commissioned rather than purchased on the local market." .

Upon winning the Prix de Rome, he moved to Italy, sharing a studio with Jean-Antoine Houdon and studying antique, Renaissance, and Baroque sculpture. A highly skillful modeler of clay, Clodion was intensely affected by the new interest in collecting terracottas. While terracotta had been traditionally used to make sketches for larger works in more permanent and expensive materials, terracotta sculptures could now be seen as independent works of art revealing the artist's inspiration and touch. Clodion's quickly executed yet detailed terracottas were, as his earliest biographer records, \"bought by amateurs even before they were finished.\" Among his clients, Catherine II of Russia unsuccessfully attempted to bring him to her court. In 1771 Clodion returned to Paris, where he continued to produce mostly in terracotta. He also worked with his brothers in other media, decorating objects such as candelabra, clocks, and vases. Drawing primarily from pagan antiquity, he created light-hearted terracotta sculptures that epitomized the Rococo style. Late in his life, when Neoclassial works were more popular, Clodion adjusted his style and worked on major public monuments in Paris." .

At school, drawing and painting were the few areas he excelled in and found rewarding. Throughout the 1960s, Close studied Abstract Expressionism in the United States and Europe. After years of painting abstract images, Close became frustrated by his inability to paint original shapes or use more than the same few colors. His portrait painting evolved from early investigations that explored the relationship between reality and illusion.Close began painting portraits of his family and friends on extremely large-scale canvases in 1970. Rather than working with live models, Close uses photographs of his subjects as the foundation for their portraits.

There he studied drawing and historical composition under painter Antoine-Jean Gros, a major promoter of theRomanticmovement in France. In 1824 he returned to Liège, where he won the Pension Darchis, an award that allowed him to travel to Rome the following year. In Rome, he concentrated on landscape painting, although he also drewantiquesubjects andgenre scenesof daily life. \n\nReturning to Liège in 1829, Closson continued his focus on landscapes, exhibiting them in theSalonde l'Emulation and in theSalonsof Brussels, Ghent, and Liège. He stopped showing at official exhibitions in 1838, devoting himself to his post as professor in the new Académie de Liège, a position that he occupied until his death. Throughout his career, he struggled for recognition for his Italian views, for Belgian taste leaned towards more conventional subject matter in the Dutch landscape tradition. Closson's work is known primarily because his wife left nearly three hundred drawings and fifty oil sketches on paper to the Académie des Beaux-Arts at Liège." .

In addition to creating independent drawings, he produced numerous designs for paintings and sculptures, and illustrated more than two hundred books. Natural talent andacademictrainingpreparedhim for success, while the connections of his parents, both of whom were engravers, insured that he would achieve a prominent position in the French court.In 1737 Cochin was employed by an agency of KingLouis XVto create commemorative prints for every birth, marriage, and funeral at court. Following a two-year trip to Italy, he was made curator of the royal drawings collection, and given lodgings in theLouvre. He was also the King's administrator of the arts from 1755 until 1770, and was responsible for assigning pensions, commissions, and placements to artists. He also established programs for the decoration of the royal chateaux.Cochin considered himself an educator and in his writing he was especially critical of the prevailingRococostyle. He advocated technical precision and the skilled selection of elements from nature. After 1773, Cochin's views fell out of favor with the court, and his later years were marked by financial struggle." .

According to Karel van Mander, Coecke traveled to Italy between 1525 and 1526 on a journey that profoundly influenced his art. By 1527 Coecke had joined Antwerp's paintersguild; by 1529 he was accepting students, who may have included his son-in-law Pieter Bruegel the Elder. After his death, his wife, a miniaturist, madewoodcutsbased on Coecke's now-lost drawings from his trip to Constantinople in 1533; these remain a key record of his style. No painting by Coecke's hand can be identified with certainty, but his most famous work, theLast Supper,is known through forty-one replicas made by his prolific workshop. Shortly before his death, Coecke was namedcourt paintertoEmperor Charles V." .

Whereas his contemporaries such as Maître François and the Chief Associate of the Bedford Master worked exclusively asmanuscriptilluminators, the Coëtivy Master painted in a variety of formats. Working for members of the royal family and court, he painted on wooden panels, designed stained-glass windows and tapestries, andilluminated manuscripts, of which more than thirty survive. He painted books of many different types, ranging from devotional manuscripts such asbooks of hoursto secular works such as theAncient History up to Caesar,Dante'sDivine Comedy,Augustine'sCity of God,and at least five copies of Boethius'sConsolation of Philosophy.Although his precise origins and given name are unknown today, technical and stylistic similarities to artists active in the north of France suggest that the Coëtivy Master came from that area, perhaps Amiens. His name today derives from that of hispatrons, Olivier de Coëtivy and his wife, the daughter of the Frenchking Charles VII." .

He set up his first photography studio in January 1856. During theSecond Empire, the reign ofNapoleon IIIin France, he ran a photography studio for twenty years, producing sequential photographs of bridges, railroads, and aqueducts. The Ministry of Agriculture, Commerce, and Public Works was his most important and consistentpatron; from 1857 to 1870 Collard photographed every bridge constructed in Paris by the ministry. He also documented the expansion of the railroad in France, competing with Édouard-Denis Baldus for that commission. In 1867 Collard sold his studio to his son." .

After moving to Rome about 1706, his exuberant Giordanesque style increasingly incorporated the tempering influence of Carlo Maratti'sclassicism. By the second quarter of the 1700s, Conca had become Rome's preeminent painter, receiving a constant stream of commissions forfrescoesand sending hisaltarpiecesthroughout Europe. Italian collectors and European visitors to Rome eagerly sought his smaller easel paintings--lyrical,Rococopieces with lively brushwork and soft colors.In about 1710, Conca established his Accademia del Nudo, which attracted many followers from Italy and abroad. Pompeo Batoni was among its pupils, and engravers there disseminated Conca's style across Europe through their prints. Conca twice served as director of Rome's Accademia di San Luca. In 1739 he wrote theAmmonimenti,a theoretical work containing moral and artistic precepts for young men intending to become painters. Upon returning to Naples around 1752, he created dazzlingillusionisticfrescoes and canvases." .

After a sojourn in France, he joined Antwerp'sGuildofSaint Lukeby 1570. With religious strife in the Spanish-occupied Netherlands, the Calvinist Coninxloo fled north to escape persecution in 1585 and moved to Germany in 1587. His experience drawing tapestrycartoonsthere may have influenced his departure from the tradition of panoramic landscape. He began introducing groups offoregroundtrees that obstructed vistas, sharp contrasts of light and dark, and stylized foliage.In 1595 Coninxloo moved to Amsterdam, where his landscape style coalesced into seemingly direct glimpses of nature. His up-close, heroic landscapes were based on reality but also incorporated idealization and decorative aspects, creating a feeling of unity between humans and nature and between landscape and viewer. Coninxloo may have known of similar artistic explorations in Italy through prints. His dense, airless forest scenes influenced Jan Brueghel the Elder and inspired the Dutch realist painters of the 1600s. \"[Coninxloo] is, as far as I know, the best landscape painter of his time; his style is now frequently imitated in Holland,\" wrote artist Karel Van Mander in 1604." .

As a surveyor and designer of railroad bridges, he was familiar with a variety of optical instruments, including thecamera obscura. Almost as soon as the invention of thedaguerreotypewas announced, Constable became interested in mastering this new process.In 1841 Constable opened a portrait studio in Brighton, England. On a visit to that seaside town in the following year, Prince Albert selected Constable's studio for his first photographic portrait sitting. For a time, securing this royal patron established the studio's reputation astheplace for European nobility to be photographed.To achieve favorable likenesses, Constable carefully controlled the lighting in his studio. Using a rotating platform, heavy velvet hangings, and blue-colored glass, he modeled his portrait subjects almost like a sculptor." .

Among his most famous designs were the Madeleine church in Paris and a renovation of the Palais Royal for the duc d'Orléans.A colleague described Contant d'Ivry's design for the Palais Royal as an ideal compromise \"between the two excesses\" of the Rococo and theclassicalstyles.

A crippled left leg obliges him to carry a crutch.\"Both agilderand a painter of bouquets, garlands, and baskets of flowers and fruit, Cornaille was thought \"not so good at drawing as with his use of color\" when he began work.

He worked mainly decorating tea services, plates, and cups, and occasionally painting potpourri vases." .

He also decorated government buildings and painted religious works for French churches. Unfortunately, many of his paintings have been destroyed, so today he is known chiefly through his many drawings and engravings.Corneille, whose younger brother was also a successful painter, received his earliest artistic training from his father, painter Michel Corneille the Elder. He then studied underclassicizingpainters Charles Le Brun and Pierre Mignard, whose powerful protection helped him to receive commissions. Winning thePrix de Romein 1659 allowed Corneille to study in Rome for four years, where he developed a great admiration for the the Carracci, whose work he copied extensively while there.Admitted to theAcadémie Royalein 1663, Corneille moved up the teaching ranks, becoming professor and then counselor. A famous painter in his own day and the most highly esteemed of the three Corneilles, he shared his father's admiration for Italian art and taste for well-ordered compositions." .

After perhaps a year of study in Antwerp, he returned to Haarlem. Cornelisz.'s first official commission, a militia company portrait, brought him great acclaim. A milestone in Dutch group depictions, it influenced Frans Hals and later Amsterdam painters with its liveliness and variety. Around this time, Cornelisz., Karel van Mander, and Hendrick Goltzius founded the \"Haarlem Academy,\" which provided the opportunity to draw from live models andplaster casts. Before this time, no Dutch artists studied the nude, but Cornelisz. made the naked figure the principalmotifof his drawings. Scholars are uncertain whether or not he drew from life.In 1588 Goltzius's engravings after five of Cornelisz.'s paintings made him famous. He produced many drawings for prints in the next fifteen years. Cornelisz. was later named the city painter of Haarlem and helped reorganize Haarlem'sGuildofSaint Lukein 1630, eliminating its medieval organization and elevating the status of the artists." .

Undeterred and blessed with an independent income, he pursued his own course: to preserve the freshness of his impressions of nature. TheImpressionists, whom he later befriended, embraced this intention, but unlike them, Corot painted only sketches outdoors; he composed his finished paintings in the studio.When Corot was twenty-six, he decided to make art his career. With his father's financial support, he received training and traveled, visiting Italy three times. On his first trip, he painted small landscape studies with simple forms and a crisp, pure light that influenced many younger painters. In the 1850s, Corot began painting the silvery, feathery landscapes that brought him such popularity-and were frequently forged, even in his own lifetime. Still later, for his own pleasure, he painted figures, which he seldom exhibited.Kindly \"Père Corot\" was universally beloved and generous. He supported Jean-François Millet's widow and bought a house for the ailing, destitute Honoré Daumier." .

His ability to manipulate light and shade to create luminous atmospheric effects resulted in some of the most sumptuous religious paintings of theItalian Renaissance. Giorgio Vasari, a sixteenth-century biographer of artists, wrote, \"everything that is to be seen by his hand is admired as something divine.\" Correggio was profoundly influenced by the style and technique used by the painter Andrea Mantegna.By the age of twenty-nine, Correggio was probably working in Parma, the center of his greatest activity. Thefrescoeshe painted in the dome of thecathedralthere served as a model of dome decorations long after his death. Correggio inspired future generations of artists as diverse as the Carracci family, Rubens, and Boucher." .

A year later he became a master in theGuildofSaint Luke. His earliest known works were mostly life-sized scenes of the daily life of colorful subjects such as smokers, gypsies, and fortune-tellers. A colleague recommended Cossiers to the Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens, but their collaboration did not happen until nearly a decade later. During the second half of the 1630s, Cossiers made numerous paintings from Rubens's designs. Following Rubens's death in 1640, Cossiers painted biblical and other religiousnarrativesfor churches in the southern Netherlands. His late work is noted for its subtle use of color and for its sympathetic emotional portrayals of his subjects." .

Early on he was influenced by the austere Ferrarese painters Cosimo Tura and Ercole de' Roberti, and he may have been the pupil of one of them.By 1483 Costa had settled in Bologna, where he lived until 1506, except for a brief interlude in Ferrara and trips to Tuscany and Umbria. In Bologna he decorated many chapels withfrescoes, in addition to making easel paintings. Some works show the influence of Perugino, Raphael's teacher, whose work heralded theRenaissance. Costa'sMadonna and Child with Saintsaltarpieceof 1492 in Bologna's San Petronio church is one of his few securely dated works.After earlier commissions from the Gonzaga family, in 1507 he moved to Mantua to become their court painter, succeeding Andrea Mantegna. Costa remained there until his death, painting a range of subjects from portraits to religious paintings." .

Unlike his father and two brothers, who were gem-engravers, he became a painter. He trained with twoRococoartists, but he developed his own, more traditional,classicizingstyle by studying the works of Raphael and Domenichino. Early in his prolific career, he received important commissions from both Italian and foreign clients.Costanzi painted an impressive variety of subjects--allegorical and mythological scenes, military scenes, religious subjects, and portraits. He decorated villas and churches in his native Italy as well as in Spain and France, and he also painted the decoration of a throne room for the Spanish court." .

An early pastel portrait gained him recognition and even inspired a love poem, \"Address to Celia's picture.\" By the 1760s, he had achieved wide-reaching success as the pre-eminent pastel painter in England. Cotes helped found the Society of Artists and became its director in 1765. Three years later he became a founding member of theRoyal Academy. In his last decade, Cotes began to paint more in oil, a medium less labor intensive and more profitable than pastel. However, he remained renowned as a pastelist: John Russell wrote his famous 1772 treatise,The Elements of Painting with Crayon,as an explanation of Cotes's pastel technique, and Cotes was referred to as \"the Rosalba Carriera of England.\" His inventivecompositions, dramatic use of saturated color, bold handling of line, and informalnaturalismcontributed to Cotes's fame.

Only three vases by him have survived; all three are bell-kraters decorated with a phlyax scene on one side and a scene of women and youths on the other. The Cotugno Painter also characteristically left bands of plain red, unglazed clay on the foot of the krater.As with most ancient artists, the real name of the Cotugno Painter is unknown, and he is identified only by the stylistic traits of his work. Scholars named him after a vase once in the private Cotugno collection in the Italian city of Bari." .

They followed the military campaigns that his brother drew, then studied in Bologna, Florence, and Siena, arriving in Rome by 1638.Courtois trained himself by copying Giovanni Lanfranco's and Andrea Sacchi's works and by drawing from nude models. He first studied under Pietro da Cortona, his most important teacher, while painting afrescoin an elegant Roman palazzo in 1656. In the following year he completed his first major public project, two frescoes for a Roman church. They display a strong sense of drama and a morenaturalisticapproach to the figure than did his later work, which followed the popularclassicizingmanner of Roman lateBaroquepainting. Courtois made many red chalk studies that demonstrate his great care in preparing the figures for his paintings. He also madecompositiondrawings in pen, ink, andwash." .

His early influences included his father, French painter Noël Coypel, and Charles Le Brun. But as a young adult, his paintings and drawings more often reflected the influence ofFlemishartist Peter Paul Rubens, emphasizing the interaction of colors to create the illusion of physical space. In this respect, Coypel's body of work is part of a critical transitional phase in French art.His aspirations led him to draw and paint scenes consistent with the Royal Court's desires, but royal commissions were scarce when France fought a war in the late 1600s. Coypel turned to private commissions to earn a living, capitalizing on the opportunity to move away from painting grand religious scenes and instead create canvasses on lighter subjects in a less rigid style. Eventually, Coypel's goal was realized when he was appointedle premier peintre du Roiin 1715, less than seven years before his death." .

He eventually becamepremier peintrehimself in 1747, as well as director of theAcadémie Royale.Besides talents in painting and engraving, Coypel possessed some literary talent: he produced two tragedies, several comedies, prose, and some poetry. He also excelled as a tapestry designer for the Gobelins manufactory; the twenty-eight scenes he created for theDon Quixoteseries woven continuously between 1714 and 1794, were his most successful.

A banker, Cozzi first became involved in the ceramics business as a partner in another porcelain factory. When the owners returned to Germany, Cozzi founded his own factory in the first and second floors of a palazzo and was soon offered financial support by the Venetian board of trade.Inventive and clever in his marketing tactics, Cozzi quickly cultivated demand for his wares among the fashionable upper classes. Influential friends published articles in a Venetian newspaper describing the factory and praising its works. In May 1767 the enterprising Cozzi distributed a handbill inviting \"ceramists adept at wheel-throwing, modeling, and painting [to his factory] for suitable and profitable recompense.\" Hiring potters away from rival enterprises brought anger and litigation from their owners but did not stop Cozzi.The fashion for drinking tea, coffee, and chocolate from porcelain cups in Venice's new coffeehouses, along with the general popularity of porcelain during the 1700s, fueled tremendous demand for Cozzi's wares. In addition to producingsoft-paste porcelain, his factory also constructed kilns formaiolicaand creamware, less costly ceramics available to a wider public." .

After Albrecht Dürer's visit to the Netherlands in 1521, Crabbe began exploring the medium of printmaking. He combinedItalianatefigure types with a concern for atmosphere and depth in landscape and a focus on ordinary daily life and humble people, both taken from Lucas van Leyden's prints.In 1539 Crabbe acquired the workshop of an artist who had introduced the South German etching technique to the North. Crabbe was one of etching's earliest Netherlandish practitioners. He also worked as an engraver and woodcutter, but his etching was notable for success in a medium that his contemporaries considered limited. Using only lines, he depicted striking lighting and atmospheric conditions and created graphic equivalents for painting. Combining the Netherlandish restraint of gesture and interest in light and shadow with the dashing, delicate pen work of contemporary German artists, Crabbe made precise preparatory drawings for his etchings." .

In 1633, Adriaen Brouwer, a prominent genre painter who probably became Craesbeeck's teacher, was imprisoned for tax debts at the Antwerp jail where his future pupil baked bread. Craesbeeck soon enrolled as both a baker and a painter in theGuildofSaint Luke. Eighteen years later he had moved to Brussels, where he was a master in the painter's guild and later became a town representative.Craesbeeck specialized in smallgenre sceneswith few figures. His early paintings were very similar to Brouwer's in their handling of paint,composition, subject matter, and approach. Like Brouwer, he painted peasants, often in taverns, though he later turned completely to the middle-class world. Craesbeeck also attempted to depict emotions and applied colors thinly, leaving the ground partly visible as his master had done. His mature work adopted an established repertory of figures that makes his work easy to recognize: bearded men with flat or fur-decked caps and women with white bonnets or conspicuous straw hats." .

Around 1501 he went to Vienna, where he focused on drawing ruins and windswept trees. In 1505 he became court painter to Frederick the Wise of Saxony in Wittenberg, a position he maintained for life under various electors.\n\nAt court, Cranach specialized in portraits. Bold design, intense color, and gracefully outlined costumes typify his court likenesses. He may have invented the full-length portrait as an independent work of art. Like Albrecht Dürer before him, Cranach created fine, valued engravings andwoodcutsas well as paintings. His large workshop included his sons Hans and Lucas.\n\nOne of Wittenberg's leading citizens, Cranach owned a bookshop and a pharmacy and served on the city council in addition to his work at court. As Martin Luther's close friend, he supervised the printing of Luther's propaganda pamphlets; designed woodcuts for Luther's translation of the New Testament; paintedaltarpiecesfor Lutheran churches; and painted, engraved, and madewoodcutportraits of Protestant Reformers and princes." .

He worked at various jobs before becoming a sailor himself, from 1926 until 1927. After studying art in Los Angeles, he briefly held a job as an illustrator at Walt Disney's studio. Crawford spent the next decade traveling widely and studying art, meeting with early success in exhibiting his work. Primarily a painter, his style is best described as Precisionism, a style popular in the 1920s and 1930s and characterized by the depiction of sharply defined forms.Crawford took up photography around 1937 and continued to photograph during his travels, making the same kind of sharply focused images in photographs that he did in his paintings. In 1950 he began to photograph and document the lives of black jazz musicians in New Orleans, Louisiana, a subject and city to which he would frequently return. Additionally, Crawford held many teaching positions throughout his career, from Honolulu to Buffalo. In 1969, he premiered the first of several short films,Various Depths.An energetic man despite the onset of cancer discovered in 1971, Crawford continued to travel extensively and create until his death at age seventy-one." .

He rejected hisclassicizingacademic training and developed his own dramatically individualistic style, incorporating the tenets ofhumanismand the technique ofchiaroscuro. Still, Crespi's style owes a debt to the work of the Bolognese painters Lodovico Carracci and Guercino. By 1690 he had traveled to Venice, where he experienced richly colored Venetian painting, and to Parma, where he studied Correggio'sfrescoes. Above all, Crespi's work reflects his sincerity, tenderness, and keen observation of nature, transformed by startling light effects and thick, fluid application of paint. Typically, artists in the 1700s used mainly muted,pastelcolors. However, like Alessandro Magnasco, Crespi chose dark shadows contrasted with strong lights. Crespi's religious and historical subjects were often painted in a direct and intimate manner that betrays his love ofgenre scenes. Few artists had ever portrayed the grime and squalor of contemporary reality without resorting to satire.In 1700 Crespi opened a school in Bologna, where he influenced his Venetian pupils most; they continued to explore his interest in the effects of light and genre scenes. A devoted, long-lived family man, Crespi went blind in his last years." .

He worked as bothébénisteand sculptor to the Regent,Philippe II, duc d'Orléans. His furniture was often decorated with plainveneers, usually of satinwood andamaranth, or veneers in patterns ofparquetry.Though Cressent was best known for the highly sculpturalgiltbronzemountsthat ornamented his furniture, these mounts also jeopardized his career. In order to supervise production and guarantee the quality of his mounts, Cressent employed master casters and gilders in his workshop. This practice broke the strict rules of the Frenchguildsystem, and the guild prosecuted him for practicing the two professions of cabinetmaking and gilding in the same workshop. In order to pay the resulting fines, Cressent was forced to hold sales of his stock. The catalogues from these auctions, which he wrote himself, provide important evidence to identify his works, as Cressent's furniture was always unsigned." .

The Curtis family moved to the Washington territory, and around 1892 the newly married Curtis bought his first photographic studio in Seattle for 150 borrowed dollars. It quickly becametheplace to be photographed. He later settled in Los Angeles, where he operated photographic studios at various times on La Cienega Boulevard and in the Biltmore Hotel. As a friend of Hollywood producer Cecil B. DeMille, Curtis was commissioned to make film stills of some of DeMille's epics, includingThe Ten Commandments.Curtis is best known, however, for his exhaustive photo-documentation of American Indians. Over a thirty-year period he producedThe North American Indian, a twenty-volume survey of more than one hundred tribes with supplementary photogravure portfolios. At least two hundred sets were sold, each priced at the then-astronomical sum of three thousand to forty-five hundred dollars. Curtis intended to preserve the vanishing native cultures, but he actually constructed the portraits out of nostalgia for cultures long past; rather than being historically accurate, he often used wrongly attributed cultural artifacts and costumes as props. Nevertheless, Curtis succeeded in creating a powerful record of faces and locations that transcended the standard ethnographic catalogue.In 1914 he also made a feature film,In the Land of the Head Hunters, based on the lives of the Kwakiutl, a Pacific Northwest Coast Native American tribe." .

The Elector was fond of Cuvilliés and arranged for him to learn mathematics and engineering before sending him to Paris to study architecture. There he studied the newly emergingFrench Rococostyle under the personal supervision of the younger François Blondel.When he returned to Munich, Cuvilliés was appointed court architect of Bavaria. He was responsible for designing a suite of state rooms at the Residenz and, in the park of the Nymphenberg palace, the small Amalienberg pavilion, considered one of the masterpieces of Rococo decoration. Between 1738 and 1756, he published fifty-five books of designs for interior decoration, wall paneling, ceilings, furniture, wrought-iron work, and other decorative objects. These engravings were important for disseminating the Rococo style throughout Europe." .

After his father's death in 1651 and his mother's three years later, Cuyp inherited considerable property and became a leading citizen in town affairs. In 1658 he married a rich widow and his output, which had previously been prolific, declined.Generally, Cuyp painted landscapes and animals, but he also created seascapes, still lifes, and portraits. He often traveled the Dutch rivers, sketching from nature. His preferred scenes were idyllically peaceful river views with sun-drenched skies and landscapes with cows silhouetted against the sky, animals he endowed with as much grandeur as human heroes. Cuyp's earliest works share Jan van Goyen's monochromatic style, but by 1648 he may have visited Utrecht, Holland's artistic center, whereItalianateinfluence was strong. Cuyp's 1650s works display greater coloristic differentiation and the soft, golden glow of Italian light. Working in provincial isolation, he had little effect on other Dutch painters. His compositions were popular with eighteenth-century English collectors, and his poetic light exerted a strong influence on English painting." .

He was expelled from Mantua in 1450 after having been convicted of a grave crime, and he eventually settled in Pavia sometime before 1461. His most famous work is the Visconti Hours, a book of hours commissioned by Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, which Belbello completed after two other artists had left it unfinished. Especially toward the end of his career, he collaborated on manuscript projects with accomplished northern Italian painters and illuminators such as Andrea Mantegna and Girolamo da Cremona. Belbello painted strongly modeled, monumental figures with close-set facial features, and he was known for his distinctive use of bright colors such as blues, yellows, and pinks. He often filled the borders of the pages he illuminated with lush flowers and plants with heavy, fleshy leaves. His fanciful compositions and unusual treatment of familiar iconographic themes set him apart from other artists working at the time." .

The artist is better known by the name that Giorgio Vasari called him--Stefano da Verona--referring to his many commissions in that city, including paintings in church interiors and on building facades. Primarily a fresco and panel painter, Stefano's only known illuminated manuscript commission is a choir book from which only six illuminations survive. Characteristic of Stefano's painting style are his softly modeled figures, his use of curving lines, and the fine gold highlights that articulate such details as landscape and figures' drapery." .

He studiedminiaturepainting, portraiture, and landscapes and was accepted to the prestigiousRoyal Academyfor further study after turning twenty. Academy professors remarked on his gentleness, cheerful good nature, and great promise as an artist.Dadd'sNeoclassicalpaintings of ancient subjects, theatrical in concept, followed in the tradition of Lawrence Alma Tadema. He painted scaled-down human figures in small, luminous landscapes of carefully rendered plants and flowers.In 1842 Dadd left England on a one-year drawing trip throughout Europe and the Middle East. Shortly after his return, he lost his sanity, as had three of his siblings. Dadd murdered his father, attempted to kill a stranger, and spoke of killing the pope and the emperor of Austria, insisting that the Egyptian god Osiris requested these acts. In 1843 the courts and his family committed him to an insane asylum, where he remained for the next forty-three years, continuing to paint." .

As the leading Florentine painter of his generation, Daddi helped to ensure that this idea, which heralded the Renaissance and came to be taken for granted until the modern age, was kept alive. For hundreds of years, Italian painting had been based on the abstractions of Byzantine art, which stressed patterning, flatness, and ethereal-looking people. Daddi's figures, like Giotto's, have bulk and physicality. As in everyday experience, their form is modeled by light that is earthly and real. Still, throughout his career, Daddi retained some elements of Byzantium's legacy of abstraction, choosing its almond-shaped eyes, ornamental patterning, and gold backgrounds.Like many in Florence's post-Giotto generation, Daddi later was probably influenced by Sienese art, with its gracefulness and tender human relationships. Ivory carvings from France also may have contributed to the lyric sweetness of his art. He rarely painted frescoes. His large workshop specialized in small, devotional panels, which retain a sense of intimacy even when intended for public places. Daddi is recorded as being artistically active between 1312 and 1347, and scholars estimate that he died soon after." .

Around 1770 he studied under agenrepainter and ahistory painter. He followed one of them to Rome in 1775 and then traveled throughout Italy. Unlike most of his contemporaries, Danloux preferred drawing the Roman countryside and portraits instead of ancient monuments.Settling in Lyon, France, in 1783, Danloux established himself as a portraitist in the relaxed, informal manner of Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin. After moving to Paris in 1785, his reputation grew as a portraitist to the aristocracy. Danloux paid great attention to rendering fabrics, embroidery, and accessories in both oils and chalk. After another sojourn in Rome, Danloux returned to Paris in 1789, where he was commissioned to make portraits of the royal family. Soon theFrench Revolutionforced him to flee to London. Influenced by fashionable English portrait painters like George Romney, Danloux excelled in family groups and portraits of children, whom he captured in natural, spontaneous poses. He also began painting history subjects. He returned to Paris in 1801 and spent his remaining years frustrated by his failure to establish himself as a history painter." .

As with most vase-painters, the real name of the Darius Painter is unknown, and he is identified only by the stylistic traits of his work. He is named for a vase in Naples that depicts Darius, a Persian king.The Darius Painter was one of the first to decorate very large vases, sometimes over three feet in height. He was also one of the most successful painters in exploiting the new compositional possibilities presented by these large vases. The Darius Painter depicted myths and episodes from stories not usually portrayed in vase-painting. His choice of subjects, elaborate compositions, and style were influenced by what he saw in contemporary theatrical productions." .

Daumier died blind and a pauper without ever having received a painting commission.A glazier's son who moved to Paris at age eight, Daumier spent his time after apprentice jobs copying works in theLouvre. When a museum official persuaded his parents to allow him to become an artist, he began his artistic training, mastering the new medium oflithography.For his biting depictions of Emperor Louis-Philippe in the weekly journalLa Caricaturein 1832, Daumier spent six months in prison and began painting. After the state suppressedLa Caricaturein 1835, Daumier joinedLe Charivariand turned to social satire. He ridiculed the bourgeoisie and the legal system and unsentimentally showed the misery of the masses with his crayon, much as Charles Dickens observed London in words.Daumier's paintings were made mostly between 1855 and 1870, when his work forLe Charivariwas slow and before he lost his sight. His nearly four thousand lithographs, in addition to his paintings, drawings, watercolors, and sculptures comprise the largest visual legacy of any artist before 1900." .

After eight years of struggle, he finally won the covetedPrix de Rome. Visits to ruins, exposure toNeoclassicaldoctrines, and study of Nicolas Poussin'sclassicismencouraged him to adopt a style and subject matter derived from antiquity.Returning in Paris in 1780, David soon prospered. Large canvases ofclassicalthemes brought him election to the Académie Royale in 1784 and sensational success at the ParisSalonin 1785. His firm linear contours, even lighting, pure colors, and frieze-likecompositionwere admired, but more than his style was revolutionary. The paintings came to be regarded as a political manifesto for ending the corruption of an effete aristocracy and returning to the stern, patriotic morals attributed to republican Rome.\"TheRobespierreof the brush,\" David served in theFrench Revolutionarygovernment, painted portraits of its leaders, designed its republican festivals and funerals, and suffered imprisonment when the political winds shifted. Despite his impassioned earlier rhetoric-\"The artist must be a philosopher.... an artistic genius should have no other guide except the torch of reason\"-David handily transferred his loyalties toNapoleon Bonaparte, the new ruler of France. Exiled to Brussels after Napoleon's fall from power, David continued to train young painters and draftsmen." .

Later, as a winner of thePrix de Rome, he studied antiquities in Italy, where he met Antonio Canova and absorbed current trends inNeoclassicalart. Yet, regarding sculpture as \"the recorder of posterity,\" he often tempered theclassicizingelements in his work with a vigorous realism. Back in Paris, David d'Angers created a sensation at the 1817Salonwith his monument to the French general, theprince de Condé. The sculpture's contemporary dress and diagonal movement challenged Neoclassical taste, heralding theRomanticstyle that David d'Angers later developed more fully. During the next two decades, he received numerous important monumental commissions while also sculpting the many portraits that made him one of the era's most influential portrait sculptors. In 1826 he was appointed professor at the École des Beaux-Arts.After Napoleon III's coup d'état in 1851, David d'Angers was temporarily exiled for his republican beliefs. When he returned to France in 1853, ill health prevented him from working again. In the course of his astonishingly prolific career, he produced over 50 full-size statues, 150busts, and over 500 portraitmedallionsof the era's major literary, political, and artistic figures." .

As partner in the publishing firm Copeland and Day, which he founded in 1884, Day indulged his passion for English literature, publishing exquisite small-edition, hand-bound volumes by the likes ofDanteGabriel Rossetti and Day's friend Oscar Wilde. Although Copeland and Day published ninety-eight books and periodicals, the firm was never financially successful.Day began to photograph in 1886; and he wrote extensively about photography's position as a fine art and organized international photography exhibitions to further his claim. He asked: \"And if it chance that [a] picture is beautiful, by what name shall we call it? Shall we say that it is not a work of art, because our vocabulary calls it a photograph?\"Day's photographs were controversial for their unconventional depiction of religious subject matter and for the male nudity that he employed. His style wasPictorialist, and he favoredplatinum prints, which are distinguished by their fine detail and ability to render a full range of soft tones. He lost interest in photography when a shortage of platinum during World War I made printing prohibitively expensive and eventually impossible. He died twenty years later, in relative obscurity." .

On his travels, Boissieu developed a particular interest in landscape painting and spent as much time sketching outdoors as he did studying in museums. Boissieu was of fragile health and could not tolerate the strong odor of turpentine used in oil painting; instead he focused his energies on engravings and drawings in ink andwash.A great admirer of Rembrandt van Rijn, Boissieu approached engraving with the idiosyncratic touch of the draftsman: Atmospheric andtonaleffects took precedence over sharp lines and absolute clarity. Boissieu's engraved landscapes are bathed in light and shadow and populated with the rural figures and architectural forms characteristic of Dutch landscape painting.Boissieu achieved great commercial and critical success during his lifetime; artists and dignitaries passing through Lyons often visited his studio. With the wider distribution of his prints in the 1800s, Boissieu's reputation continued to grow and his work was an important model for printmakers across Europe including Félix Bracquemond, Félix Vallotton, and Adolph von Menzel." .

The son of a goldsmith, La Fosse spent five years studying in Italy, where he was exposed to Venetian color, made copies after Raphael, and studied the ceiling paintings of Pietro da Cortona. Within three years of returning to Paris, he began receiving royal commissions, and in 1673 became a member of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. La Fosse painted mythological and Biblical scenes in the Louvre and the Tuileries, and spent nine years painting at Versailles. From 1689 through 1692 La Fosse created the painted decorations for the Duke of Montague's house in London. Thereafter he returned to Paris to decorate the Dome des Invalides with his painting ofSt. Louis Presenting His Arms to Christ. He continued to receive commissions for royal residences around Versailles, such asMoses Saved from the Waters, made for the Petits Appartements. La Fosse was a key influence on Antoine Watteau, whom he introduced into Paris' artistic and intellectual circles. La Fosse's robust, colorful painting style was an important precursor to the lighter and more graceful Rococo style that dominated French taste in the early 1700s." .

A painter,illuminator, and designer of stained glass, he was known formerly only by names of convenience, such as the Saluces Master, after one of hispatrons, or the Master of the Turin Trinity, after one of his best paintings. Recently discovered documents show that de Lonhy worked in Toulouse and Barcelona early in his career. He perhaps passed through Lyons and Avignon, but settled in the Savoy region of France, near the present-day border with Italy. There he produced amanuscriptfor Yolande of France, widow of the duke of Savoy.Characteristic of his style is the skillful combination of the monumental with an attention to subtle details. His figures are often heavy and dressed in ample garments with deep folds, yet they wear dreamy expressions and their flesh is modeled with an uncommon softness and luminosity. His generally subdued range of rich browns and golds is offset by touches of brilliant color." .

His earliest known picture, a small panel signed and dated 1639, shows acofferedbarrel vault reflecting candlelight in Rotterdam's Laurenskerk. His imaginary interiors of the 1640s often betrayed an enthusiasm for flashy effects like candlelit vaults and pools of shade thrown by glowing chandeliers.Imaginary church views were De Lorme's specialty for the first twenty years of his career, but around 1652 he turned suddenly to painting simple and accurate renditions of local churches with a few figures, probably inspired by painters in nearby Delft. During the 1650s, he painted church interiors close-up, bathed in light and atmosphere. He painted the Laurenskerk at least seventeen times, so accurately that his paintings were used by the church's restorers after World War II.In the 1660s De Lorme refined his simple, realistic style into a more decorative manner, using architecture to create an elegant geometric pattern rather than an objective view." .

He exhibited photographs as an amateur photographer when he was around twenty-six years old. The following year he relocated from Dresden to London, where he was admitted to theRoyal Photographic Societyand theLinked Ring. He maintained a professional correspondence and friendship with Alfred Stieglitz; de Meyer's photographs were published in several issues of Stieglitz's publicationCamera Workand he eventually joined Stieglitz'sPhoto-Secession. In 1914 publisher Condé Nast hired de Meyer as the first full-time photographer atVoguemagazine and contracted him to work forVanity Fair. In 1921 he left Nast to work for the William Randolph Hearst publicationHarper's Bazaarin Paris, where he became the preeminent fashion photographer of the day. From early on and especially during his magazine years, de Meyer associated with and photographed the upper echelons of society.Around 1934, a new editor with a mission to redefine the renamedHarper's Bazaarled to the end of de Meyer's illustrious career with the magazine. After travels in Europe, he relocated to Hollywood at the end of the thirties. He died in Los Angeles, remembered for his famous friends but virtually forgotten as a photographer." .

His most famous post was ascourt artistfor the Este family in Ferrara. The son of the doorkeeper at the Este castle, by 1473 de' Roberti had left Ferrara and was working in Bologna in the studio of Francesco del Cossa, an artist heavily influenced by Andrea Mantegna. Mantegna's linear style remains evident in de' Roberti's paintings during his lifetime. De' Roberti's first secure works--contributions to thepredellaand the lateralpilastersfor thealtarpiececommissioned from del Cossa for the Griffoni Chapel in San Petronio, Bologna--are from the 1470s.While there is no documentation that de' Roberti went to Venice, he may have visited there around 1480. His only extant documented work, a large altarpiece for a church in Ravenna, is permeated with aclassicalcalm reminiscent of the contemporary paintings of Giovanni Bellini, a sensibility whose deep pathos endured throughout de' Roberti's career. As court artist in Ferrara from 1487, de' Roberti worked almost exclusively for the Este family. De' Roberti's role went far beyond making art: he accompanied Alfonso d'Este on a papal visit to Rome, served as wardrobe manager forIsabella d'Este'swedding in Mantua, and may even have made salamis." .

A child prodigy, he died at the young age of thirty-eight; according to legend, he slept on a block of marble, hoping to find inspiration in his dreams.Deare was born into a family of jewelers and early on proved his extraordinary talent at carving. He began an apprenticeship in 1776; the following year, when he entered theRoyal Academyschools, he became the youngest artist ever to win the Academy's gold medal. In 1784, he won an Academy stipend to study for three years in Rome. Arriving in 1785, he remained there until his death.Deare supported himself in Rome with commissions from English patrons visiting Rome on the Grand Tour. Although he executed a number of portraitbustsand copies after theantique, the staples of Neoclassical artists, his most distinguished works are a series ofreliefsof historical, mythological, andallegoricalsubjects. These he carved in a typically sensuous style, displaying an extraordinary range of depth and leaving visible tool and drill marks." .

On January 30, 1764, the records of theAcadémie de Saint-Luc(theguildof decorative painters, designers, and sculptors) show that he was admitted there as a painter. Seven months later, the guild of master enamellers seized his stock, as strict guild regulations prevented members from practicing both crafts, painting and enameling. Decla's stock was only returned the following year when a ruling confirmed that, as he was a member of two guilds, the enamellers and enamel-painters, he was entitled to make enameled clock faces. Today only two clock faces signed by him are known, one of which is in the Getty Museum's collection." .

In his early career, during the 1370s, he was active in the workshop of Andrea Orcagna, whose work featured gold backgrounds, attention to the picture's surface, and brilliant colors. Showing no compulsion to render a scene in realistic detail, del Mazza allowed the needs of the theme and their inherent symbolism to determine his stylized approach to painting. In the 1390s he became an independent artist." .

About 1516 he traveled to Rome with a painter called Vaga, from whom he took his name. Two years later he was recruited into Raphael's studio. While collaborating on theVaticanLogge, Perino learned about stucco work and designinggrotesques.After spending two years in Florence to escape the plague, Perino was in Rome again by 1524. His Romanfrescoesachieved a refinement and elegance of form by blending Michelangelo's grandeur and power with Raphael's grace. Through contact withManneristartists Rosso Fiorentino and Parmigianino, Perino developed a more ornamental style.The Sack of Rome sent Perino to Genoa in 1528, where he formed an enduring local school and studied Giulio Romano's energetic decorations. Returning to Rome around 1536, he became principal decorator for Pope Paul III. His post-Genoa art profoundly influenced young painters developing the high Mannerist style in Rome." .

In 1822 Delacroix took the Salon by storm. Although the French artistic establishment considered him a wild man and a rebel, the French government, bought his paintings and commissioned murals throughout Paris. Though Delacroix aimed to balance classicism and Romanticism, his art centered on a revolutionary idea born with the Romantics: that art should be created out of sincerity, that it should express the artist's true feelings and convictions. Educated firmly in the classics, Delacroix often depicted mythological subjects, themes encouraged by the reigning Neoclassical artists at the Académie des Beaux-Arts. But Delacroix's brilliant colors and passionate brushwork frightened them; their watchwords were \"noble simplicity and calm grandeur.\" They barred him from academy membership until 1857, and even then he was prohibited from teaching in the École des Beaux-Arts. For those very reasons, he was an inspiration to the Impressionists and other young artists. Paul Cézanne once said, \"We are all in Delacroix.\" Intensely private, Delacroix kept a journal that is renowned as a profoundly moving record of the artistic experience." .

Unlike the ceaseless, sensationalist flow of mass media images, Delahaye's photographs of war, natural catastrophes, or political upheaval, evade straightforward interpretation or resolution.Delahaye began his career as a photojournalist. Specializing in war photography, he covered conflicts in Bosnia, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Rwanda, and Chechnya. A member of the prestigious Magnum Photos agency from 1994 to 2004, Delahaye worked independently or was commissioned by Western news magazines, especially Newsweek. But in the early 1990s, inspired in part by documentary photographer Walker Evans, Delahaye began working on more personal and extended serial projects. He realized several documentary portrait series in France, and in the winter of 1998 travelled to Russia to photograph the social consequences of the country's economic crisis. These color works depicting the struggles of the Russian people were published as a book in 2000.In 2001, Delahaye began creating large-scale color photographs of current events. Spanning the globe, Delahaye has photographed a Taliban casualty in Afghanistan, Slobodan Milosevic on trial in The Hague, and central Baghdad shortly after the US invasion. He has also captured gatherings of well-known but often unseen institutions including the World Economic Forum, UN Security Council, and OPEC. A first selection of these color images was published as History in 2003. The size of these exhibited prints emphasizes the fullness and complexity of the events depicted and invites viewers to immerse themselves in their details." .

He was recorded as a journeyman goldsmith in Paris in 1546 and worked briefly as the king's chief medallist at the royal mint in 1552. Although dismissed from that post, he continued working for the king: in 1556 he furnished designs for Henry's parade armor. Delaune took up engraving around 1557; his first dated prints, twelve plates illustrating theOld Testamentand two designs for hand mirrors, appeared in 1561. The Italian artists of the School ofFontainebleaugreatly influenced his draftsmanship and his engraving style. Delaune made hundreds of ornamental designs for jewelry and pictorial engravings, noteworthy for their decorative nature and their technical precision despite their often small size. His engravings helped to disseminate the Fontainebleau style among artists and craftsmen in France and abroad. As aProtestant, Delaune left Paris at the time of the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572, when the French government sanctioned the murdering ofHuguenots. He took refuge in Strasbourg, a free city of theHoly Roman Empire, where he mainly stayed until his return to Paris in 1580." .

Like a devoted photographer intent on capturing the major events of his time, della Bella recorded the lavish theatrical pageants of Florence's nobility, daily life in Rome and Paris, and the battlefield realities of the Thirty Years War.Della Bella began his career in the studio of a goldsmith, but apart from this early apprenticeship, della Bella was basically self-taught. Before the age of twenty, he had allied himself with the powerful Medici court, which provided him with patronage throughout his career. With the Medici's support, in 1633, della Bella traveled to Rome where he remained until 1639. During these six years, he honed his drawing skills. He largely avoided studios and worked outdoors, recording ancient and modern buildings, the countryside, public spectacles, and the daily activities of the Roman people. Della Bella would later mine his sketchbooks for figures and backgrounds for his prints. \n\n Supported by the Floretine ambassador, in 1639, Della Bella relocated to Paris. For the French nobility, della Bella created a diverse range of prints including battle scenes, architecture, and animals. He moved effortlessly between large, topographically precise landscapes and fanciful works commissioned by Parisian dealers. He returned to Florence in 1650 where he again served the Medici court." .

The della Robbias' reputation stemmed from their innovative work with glazed earthenware. The artist-biographer Giorgio Vasari reported that Luca della Robbia, Girolamo's grandfather, had invented the technique of glazing baked clay, or earthenware, but the family's closely guarded secrets actually revived ancient techniques. Girolamo learned the family business from his father, working in marble, earthenware, and bronze, alongside his brothers. By 1517, he accepted an invitation to France from KingFrançois I, who sought to create an artisticRenaissancein his country by importing Italian artists. In 1527, account books name della Robbia as master mason, engineer, architect, sculptor, and enameler at the Château Madrid, François I's Parisian residence. Girolamo also worked on other palatial French residences for members of the king's circle. After François's death, della Robbia returned to Florence, hoping to find work with Cosimo I deMedici, but his work was already considered old-fashioned in Italy.

He was trained in his native city of Antwerp, and moved to Paris in the 1770s. About ten years later he relocated to Rome, where he spent the majority of his career. Although Denis was not an official student of French landscape painter Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes, he followed the elder and more famous artist's example. Denis' cloud studies probably predate Valenciennes' influential 1800 treatise on landscape, which emphasized direct observation from nature. Both men were among the first to produce oil-on-paper sketches outdoors, a practice that became increasingly popular in the 1800s.Denis was closely associated with the French picture dealer Jean-Baptiste Lebrun, as well as his more famous wife, the painter Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun, with whom he spent time in Italy. He also enjoyed a close relationship with the head of the Frenchacademyin Rome. Denis' landscape practice consisted of painted and drawn studies from nature, as well as more highly finished landscape paintings. His sketches, like those of other landscape artists of his time, are more dynamic than his finished works." .

His brothers were stonemasons, his father was a stone carver. In his twelve-year career, Desiderio created sculpture ranging from freestanding statues to crucifixes, but he is best known for portraitbustsand elegant reliefs, especially of theMadonna and Child. Having possibly trained and collaborated with Donatello, he took the master's technique of very lowreliefin a new direction. Though he also worked in wood and stucco, Desiderio had special talent for bringing out the luminosity of marble. Unlike his predecessors, he understood that light sinks into marble crystals, then comes back to the eye, while reflections off nearby surfaces also add radiance. As a result, he seemed to breathe life into his stone subjects, particularly children. In his last works Desiderio renounced polishing: he simply filed the surface, giving the impression of seeing the marble through a light-filled haze.

He learned to carefully observe nature for his works. After a brief period in Poland, where he painted a number of portraits of members of the Polish royal family, Desportes returned to France. He decided that there was a more lucrative market for artists specializing in hunting scenes, studies of dogs, and still life pictures of fruit and flowers. His assumption was correct, and he became a favorite painter of two kings of France,Louis XIVandLouis XV. They commissioned him to record royal hunts and their favorite dogs, and he also worked on the decoration of several of the royal houses, including designing tapestries." .

Achille taught drawing and lithography to his son, Théodule Devéria, and father and son collaborated on a family portrait album from 1853 until Achille's death. They applied inkwashto several of the portraits in the album, possibly in preparation for printing lithographs from the photographs. The album photographs by Théodule are dated 1854.Théodule had a passion for Egyptology, which he shared with his friend, the photographer John Beasly Greene. He studied the Coptic language, joined the Egyptian department of theMusée du Louvrein 1855, and was eventually named assistant curator there. He traveled to Egypt in the late 1850s and 1860s, where he transcribed texts, made drawings, and photographed. A workaholic who was perpetually in poor health, Théodule died at age forty from a \"chest malady.\"" .

Often working on a monumental scale, di Suvero transforms industrial materials into evocative, dynamic abstractions. His work sometimes features movable elements and actively invites the viewer's participation.Born in Shanghai, di Suvero grew up in California. He studied philosophy and fine arts at San Francisco City College and the University of California at both Santa Barbara and Berkeley. During these studies, he took an interest in art, especially sculpture. In 1957 he moved to New York. His earliest exhibited works were in plaster, wax, and wood.Di Suvero's use of steel developed out of necessity. In 1960, he was crushed  by a freight elevator. Following this serious accident, wood proved difficult to manipulate by hand. In essence, di Suvero used heavy machinery to \"draw\" in steel, making and erasing gestures on a vast scale. His early steel pieces incorporate railroad ties, scrap metal, tires, and structural steel. This exploration has transformed over time into a focus on modern construction materials like I-beams and heavy gauge metal. Di Suvero does much of the welding, cutting, and crane work himself.In the 1960s, di Suvero protested the Vietnam War in several sculptures. He moved to Europe for four years in the early 1970s. A retrospective of his work at the Whitney Museum of American Art in the mid-1970s brought di Suvero greater prominence and acclaim. He has become especially known for what he calls \"all city\" shows--projects in which several of his often enormous forms are installed across a single city. Today, he divides his time between studios in France, California, and New York." .

He believed that a patient's mental state was manifested in her physiognomy, or facial features, and he claimed to use these photographs to help diagnose the disorders. Although Diamond published a paper on this subject, the practical results of this photo-therapy are unknown.As an avid amateur, Diamond made his first photograph just three months after William Henry Fox Talbot introduced his invention of photography in 1839. Diamond held a weekly gathering of artistic and literary friends at his home in Wandsworth, London, and later near Richmond, Surrey. In 1853, thePhotographic Societyof London was born out of this group; Diamond was a founding member, Secretary, and editor of the Society'sPhotographic Journalfor ten years. A Fellow and honorary photographer of the Society of Antiquaries, Diamond also photographed antiquities and wrote weekly articles on photography for an antiquarian periodical." .

He trained as a sculptor, traveling to Prague and Italy for experience as a journeyman. Around 1720 Dietrich settled near Munich and worked for the court joiner, Johann Pichler. He carved works for both sacred and secular buildings, producing two altars in southern German churches and ornamental filigree carving for aristocratic palaces. As a collaborator with François de Cuvilliés, he received many commissions for the decoration of rooms for the court at Munich and for noblemen's houses. The decorative woodwork of the Amalienberg pavilion at the Bavarian palace in Munich and the theater in the Residenz are two of his best known works. The document of Dietrich's appointment as court sculptor in 1736 cited his exemplary workmanship." .

At nine-by-six centimeters,carteswere primarily portraits, about the size of a conventional calling card and soon just as popular. Disdéri established his photographic practice with the manufacture of these tiny photographs; he divided a single glass plate negative to make ten different exposures and then printed them simultaneously. By 1862 he had expanded his operation to include a second studio in Paris, devoted entirely to equestrian portraits. Studios in London followed, and Disdéri, ever the showman and enterprising businessman, developed numerous photographic gimmicks to keep business afloat.Thecarte-de-visitewas popular until the late 1860s, when it was replaced by the larger cabinet card format. Disdéri photographed views of the siege of Paris in 1870 and 1871, but the changed political and social climate contributed to the demise of his studio business. Following several bankruptcies, he moved to Nice in 1877 and ran a series of photography studios there. He returned to Paris in the late 1880s and died in an institution." .

John Divola is from Southern California, and his imagery often reflects that locale by including urban Los Angeles or the nearby ocean, mountains, and desert.Divola grew up in the San Fernando Valley, which he credits as having an impact on his development as an artist. He earned a BA from California State University, Northridge in 1971 and an MA from University of California, Los Angeles in 1973. In college, the new art movements that inspired him--Minimalism, Conceptualism, and Earthworks--were often not easily accessible, but encountered through photographic documentation. \"I came to the conclusion that [photography] was the primary arena of contemporary art,\" Divola has said, \"and that all painting and sculpture and performance was, from a practical point of view, made to be photographed, to be re-contextualized, and talked or written about.\" After earning an MFA from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1974, Divola developed his own combination of performance art, sculpture, and installation, with photography at its conceptual core.One of Divola's earliest projects,Zuma(1979), brought him critical acclaim.Zumais a photographic record made over time of a beachfront property that was being used intermittently by the fire department for fire-fighting practice. As Divola observed the building over the course of two years, it was ravaged by fire, vandalism, and the artist's own graffiti. These acts of human \"intervention,\" as he saw them, became integrated with the inevitable natural processes of decay.Isolated Houses, Divola's vivid color photographs of one-room dwellings in the desert area around Twentynine Palms, California, emerged out of his longstanding interest in the Southern California landscape. At the center of each square image is a square house-sometimes shown close up, other times, at a distance. The physical relationship between each man-made structure and its immediate surroundings blur visual distinctions between what is natural and what is artificial. Another recent project isDogs Chasing My Car in the Desert(2004). Divola lives in Riverside, California and teaches at the University of California." .

He was also one of the most prolific draftsmen in Venice in the 1700s. Diziani trained first in Belluno and then Venice, where he joined the workshop of Sebastiano Ricci, who greatly influenced Diziani's development. Diziani quickly became renowned not only for his art but for the rapidity with which he worked. This speed of execution was especially evident in Diziani's oil sketches, where he quickly and confidently applied color.In 1717, Diziani accepted several commissions in Munich and Dresden and painted decorative panels and theater scenery. He returned to Venice in 1720 and remained there for the rest of his life. From 1748 to 1760, his output was especially prodigious; he painted numerous church altarpieces and fresco decorations for villas and palaces in the city and throughout the Vento. In addition to working in oil and fresco, drawings formed a significant part of Diziani's activity. At the end of his long and distinguished career, Diziani died suddenly in a coffee shop in the Piazza San Marco." .

He specialized in painting scenes after François Boucher, landscapes, chinoiseries, and figures. His initial wage of twenty-fourlivressoon grew, and by the time he was forty, he was earning one hundredlivresas one of the factory's highest paid painters.

During the Roman period, artists produced numerous copies of a statue of a naked crouching Venus, which presumably all derived from the same model. Given these two pieces of evidence, scholars have interpreted Pliny's mention as referring to an original statue of Venus crouching in her bath that no longer survives but served as a model for the Roman copies. Unfortunately, the Latin text of Pliny is unclear at this point, and the actual reading of the name and the attribution of this group of crouching Venus statues are controversial." .

Doirat is unusual for stamping his furniture with his name, a procedure uncommon among cabinetmakers until it was required byguildrules in 1743. He constructed various furniture forms, including commodes, armoires, corner cupboards, and tables, oftenveneeredwith simple parquetry in exotic woods. Doirat tried to keep exclusive control over the models for his bronze furnituremounts, although he did not carry out the casting,chasing, and gilding in his own workshop.In 1731 Doirat established a shop to sell his work on the fashionable rue Saint Honoré, a street inhabited by luxury dealers. On his death, the shop was taken over by his son-in-law, also anébéniste." .

According to Baldinucci, Dolci's final decline was triggered by Luca Giordano's 1682 visit to Florence. Luca joked that his own rapid style had brought him a fortune, but Dolci would starve if he kept taking so long. Already suffering from depression, Dolci plunged deeper into despair.Dolci's artistic training began at age nine in Jacopo Vignali's studio, where he learned to combine Vignali's emotive approach with the elegant design and bright local color of the Florentine style. Dolci probably also studied Netherlandish painting. Intensely religious, Dolci stated his \"firm intention to paint only works that would inspire the fruits of Christian piety in those who saw them.\" He specialized in devotional works, although he also earned his international reputation through the portraits and still lifes he intended for his sophisticatedpatrons. Dolci captured detail in lavish textiles, jewelry, and the face and hands. Hisevangelistportraits display his typical polished surface finish, which was probably influenced by Agnolo Bronzino, as well as aCaravaggesquechiaroscuroand Correggio's softness. Dolci had a large studio; his daughter was also a painter." .

When a friend encouraged him to accommodate others' taste, he replied, \"I work for myself alone and for the perfection of Art.\" Domenichino's sensibility, subtle composition, and delicate color heavily influenced Nicolas Poussin. The mostclassicalBolognese painter of his era, Domenichino sought the ideal form and grandeur known asdisegno.After studying with a Flemish artist, Domenichino switched to the Carracci academy's classical instruction, then assisted Lodovico Carracci. In 1602 he joined Annibale Carracci and his classmates Guido Reni and Lanfranco, his detested rival, working on the Farnese Palace's ceiling murals. Domenichino painted many of the landscapes, ordering and improving on nature. By 1614 he was Rome's leading painter. He also made easel pictures, sometimes painting on copper to achieve a polished finish. In 1621 he began working as architect for PopeGregory XV, creatingfrescoeswith a more emotional Baroque style.In 1631, with his popularity in Rome waning, Domenichino traveled to Naples to take over Guido Reni's commission to decorate a chapel in the Naples Cathedral. This was a potentially dangerous project: other non-Neapolitan artists had refused or abandoned this commission after jealous local artists threatened their lives and killed a servant of Reni's. In 1641 Domenichino died with the project unfinished, and Lanfranco succeeded him." .

Later, as an adolescent, he apprenticed to a painter in Madrid. After his master's death in about 1649, Donoso traveled to Rome, where he studied painting and architecture. Throughout his career, he drew on his Roman studies to give his paintings ambitious architectural backgrounds.Returning to Spain in 1657, Donoso entered the studio of Juan Carreño de Miranda. In the mid-1660s, he began a long association with another of Carreño's students, who succeeded Carreño ascourt painterin 1686. For many years Donoso collaborated with this colleague onfrescoprojects, of which only two still exist.Very little of Donoso's work survives today. The rich coloring and dramaticcompositionof his paintings demonstrate that he understood the current style of painting in Madrid. After being named official painter of ToledoCathedralin 1685, Donoso was appointedMaestro Mayorin 1686, which made him responsible for all architectural and artistic works in the cathedral." .

By the early 1640s, however, Doomer was probably studying with one of his father's picture-frame customers, Rembrandt van Rijn, who painted portraits of Doomer's parents. Known for his work as a topographical draftsman, Doomer largely based his drawings on his travels. In 1646 he visited his brothers at Nantes, returning to northern France via the Loire valley and sketching châteaux and towns such as Saumur and Le Havre. He made several journeys through the Netherlands and in 1663 he traveled up the Rhine. From 1669 to 1695, Doomer lived mostly in Alkmaar in the northwest Netherlands, where his home still stands. During the 1670s he sold copies of his earlier drawings. From 1671 to 1673, he reproduced an extensive group on account-book paper, which constitutes almost a quarter of his surviving works. Over three hundred of his drawings exist, most with subtle watercolorwashesand some with whitebodycolorover black chalk. Himself a collector, Doomer purchased items from Rembrandt's 1658 sale, including an album of drawings by Roelandt Savery. Doomer spent his final years in Amsterdam." .

He was the second of three sons in a wealthy, musically talented family, and began drawing caricatures of others at a young age. While his mother was immediately convinced of the young Doré's talent, his father, an engineer, pushed the boy to pursue a more practical education. While on a trip to Paris at age fifteen, he was impressed by the shop of Auber and Philipon, established publishers of caricatures and comic magazines. Calling upon his formidable charm and self-confidence, the boy drew his own versions of the shop's work, presented them to the publisher himself when his parents were otherwise occupied, and landed a three-year contract to work in Paris. So began his largely self-taught career as an illustrator. He also worked as a painter and sculptor, though to his dismay, never with the same acclaim.Doré's father died of pleurisy when the young man was seventeen, which, along with his mother's continuing faith in his abilities (or what some consider her social climbing and greed), pushed Doré to find commercial success as an artist and to support the entire family. He was prolific, and created not just the illustrations to the classics for which he is most known, but also illustrations for novels, comic books, and other journalism. His work ethic, good looks, and personality gained him acceptance into high society, including an audience with the Empress Eugenie. Many notable artists, writers, and musicians were his friends, including Rossini, Dumas, and Nadar (who also photographed him). He never married.Dramatic, chiaroscuro illustrations of the Bible and literary giants such as Rabelais, Balzac, Cervantes, Dante, and Milton made Doré's name. He had a particular gift for illustrating nature and fairy tales. An enthusiastic traveler, in his later career he spent much time in England, where he illustrated Tennyson and others, and opened his own successful Doré Gallery. Among his numerous projects,The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, published in England 1875, dates to his later, darker years. He considered it one of his \"best and most original\" works.  The book was a great commercial success, even in the United States. He died at age fifty-one of a heart attack." .

At fifteen he was appointed to the enviable position of apprentice in Rembrandt's studio, where he studied for six years. After Rembrandt left Leiden in 1631, his influence on Dou waned. Dou continued to paint on wood in a small scale but adopted cooler colors and a more highly refined technique characteristic of thefijnschilders(fine painters), a group of Leiden artists who painted small, highly finished pictures. Portraits in impasto gave way to domesticgenresubjects, enamel-smooth and rich in accessory details.Dou became one of the highest paid artists in the Netherlands and the founder of the Leiden painters' guild. Royal patrons from all over Europe sought him out. King Charles II of England even offered him the post of court painter, which he refused. Despite his international reputation, Dou scarcely left his native Leiden." .

He is known from almost forty signed vases, two of which he also potted. Altogether, almost three hundred vases have been attributed to him. Given that scholars estimate a less than 0.5% survival rate for Greek vases, Douris may have decorated about 78,000 vases in his career. Douris primarily decoratedred-figurecups, but he also painted a few vessels of other forms and in other techniques, including white-ground. His scenes are about evenly divided between mythology and depictions of everyday life. He worked with a number of potters, including Kleophrades and Euphronios, but he seems to have had a regular collaboration with Python. Onesimos depicted a cup signed by Douris on one of his vases, and there is even an ancient forgery of Douris's signature. These unusual references attest to Douris's significant influence among contemporary vase-painters." .

Dow is concerned with capturing \"human ingenuity and spirit\" in endangered regional traditions--a barbershop with a heavy patina of town life covering the walls, the opulent time capsule of an old private New York club, the densely packed display of smoking pipes in an English tobacconist shop--all artifacts of a vanishing era.Dow earned a B.F.A. and a M.F.A. in graphic design and photography from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1965 and 1968 respectively. An early influence was Walker Evans's seminal bookAmerican Photographs(1938). Dow recalls the appeal of Evans's \"razor sharp, infinitely detailed, small images of town architecture and people. What stood out was a palpable feeling of loss...pictures that seemingly read like paragraphs, even chapters in one long, complex, rich narrative.\" Soon after graduate school Dow had the opportunity to work with Evans. He was hired to print his mentor's photographs for a 1972 Museum of Modern Art retrospective.Dow has taught photography at Harvard, Tufts University and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and his work has been widely exhibited. Among his series isCorner Shops of Britain(1995), which features facades of small family-run businesses: vitrine-like shop windows showcase goods from candy jars to jellied eels. Another series, \"Time Passing\" (1984-2004), captures North Dakota \"folk art\" such as rural road signage, handpainted billboards, and ornate gravestones.Dow first gained attention for his panoramic triptychs of baseball stadiums, a project that began with an image he made of Veteran's Stadium in Philadelphia in 1980. Using an 8\" x 10\" camera, he has documented more than two hundred major and minor league parks in the United States and Canada." .

For nearly twenty-five years, Du Paquier was the only rival of Meissen, the first European porcelain manufactory to discover the recipe of Chinese porcelain.Impressed at the success of Meissen, the entrepreneurial Du Paquier, a minor court official in Vienna, decided to capitalize on its financial success. After experimenting on his own, he brought Christoph Hunger, an enamel decorator, to Vienna for assistance. In 1718 Emperor Charles VI rewarded Du Paquier by giving him an exclusive patent to manufacture \"All sorts of fine porcelain...such as are made in East India and other foreign countries, with far more beautiful colors, decoration, and forms with the help of local workmen and materials.\"In need of more help, Du Paquier lured two more important employees from his rival Meissen, including a kilnmaster who knew the exact combination of ingredients needed to make porcelain. The factory's wares soon achieved fame for their rich decoration, which included European landscapes, hunting scenes, classical mythology, and naturalistic flowers. The entire enterprise was never financially secure. Threat of imminent bankruptcy finally forced Du Paquier to sell the factory to the state in 1744, when his imperial privilege expired. While state-controlled, the factory continued to make porcelain under a succession of directors." .

The inventory made after his death reveals a large workshop with a varied range of production includingsecrétaires,writing desks, pedestals, and clocks, decorated with floralmarquetryor with Chinese or Japaneselacquer. While Dubois did not provide furniture for the French court, he did produce pieces for royalty such as Madame Elisabeth,Louis XV'sdaughter who married the Duke of Parma." .

He continued to work for his father, using his father's stamp ofI DUBOIS,and directed the family workshop with his mother after Jacques's death in 1763. Nine years later Dubois's mother relinquished control of the workshop, selling the existing stock to her son, who agreed to pay her an annuity.An inventory of the shop taken in 1772 reveals a prosperous business with about eighty pieces of furniture either finished or unfinished, including gaming tables, writing desks, screens, bookcases, and corner cupboards. Like his father, René continued to producelacquerfurniture, but he specialized in furniture painted with beige scenes on a green ground. About 1790, with the market for luxury products interrupted by theFrench Revolution, he stopped making furniture and was forced to concentrate on selling. He died in poverty in 1799." .

Though not formally trained, various Salons accepted his still lifes for display as early as 1877.A friend of Georges Seurat, Dubois-Pillet was a founder of the Société des Artistes Indépendants in 1884, helping to write the statutes of the group and becoming one of the first artists to adopt Pointillism. Dubois-Pillet exhibited regularly with the Indépendants until 1889, and the only one-man exhibition of his work held in his lifetime took place at the Revue Indépendent in 1888.He graduated from the Ecole Impériale Militaire at Saint-Cyr in 1867and fought in the Franco-Prussian war. In an effort to camouflage his artistic activities from his military career, in 1884 he began to sign works of art \"Dubois\" with the addition of his mother's maiden name, \"Pillet.\"  Though the military forbade him from participating in art exhibitions in 1886, he remained active until his death.Perhaps because of this defiance, in 1889 he was posted to Le Puy in south central France as commander of the local gendarmerie. He died there during a smallpox outbreak in 1890.The next year, 64 of his works were shown posthumously in a show at the Salon des Indépendants, but due to a reported later fire, his work remains rare today." .

About ten years later, he was a master in the guild. Between 1631 and 1649, Duck's presence is documented in Utrecht, Haarlem, and Wijk bij Duurstede. By 1656, he was living in The Hague.While not many Dutch soldiers actually fought in the Thirty Years' War---they hired mercenaries for that--paintings of soldiers became popular. Duck specialized in guardroom pictures, though like mostgenrepictures they did not command high prices, and he made etchings depicting gentlemen in contemporary dress. His painted subjects ranged from domestic activities to tavern scenes of boorish soldiers drinking, smoking, and flirting with pretty, young women of dubious virtue. They were often meant to convey moral messages, though much of thesymbolismfamiliar to seventeenth-century audiences is unclear today. Duck often painted large crowds gathered in spacious halls, using every device then known to create the illusion of space: curtains or large objects in the foreground to establish the front plane, orthogonal lines made by the tiles or boards on the floor, vistas into rooms beyond, and aerialperspective." .

Like his successful mentor, Ducreux specialized in portraiture and made many self-portraits. He was also influenced by Jean-Baptiste Greuze's oil technique. In 1769 Ducreux was sent to Vienna to paint a miniature ofLouis XVI'sfuture wife, Marie-Antoinette. An instant success, he was made a baron andpremier peintre de la reine(First Painter to the Queen).In the late 1780s, the irascible Ducreux painted \"character\" self-portraits, using his own face to study various expressions, then a popular field for artistic exploration. While in London avoiding theFrench Revolution, he engraved and published three of these expressive self-portraits and drew the last portrait ever made ofLouis XVI. In 1793 Ducreux returned to Paris, where he became associated with Jacques-Louis David, who helped him continue an official career. Ducreux's rooms became a popular meeting place for artists and musicians, who often commissioned portraits from him; his friend composer Etienne Nicolas Méhul based the main character of an opera on him. Ducreux rarely signed his paintings, and many remain wrongly attributed to other artists." .

Dürer initially trained in Nuremberg as a goldsmith, painter, and woodcutter. After visiting Venice in 1495, he intensely studied mathematics, geometry, Latin, and humanist literature. He expressed himself primarily through prints; painting was less profitable, and Lutheran church reformers disdained most religious artworks. Dürer's paintings are few and more traditional than his engravings and woodcuts. In 1498 he published the first book entirely produced by an artist,The Apocalypse, which included fourteen woodcuts illustrating the Book of Revelation. Its vivid imagery, masterly draftsmanship, and complex iconography established his reputation. After visiting Italy again from 1505 to 1507, Dürer's art assimilated Renaissance principles. Unlike his earlier, more Gothic woodcuts, Dürer's engravings of 1513 and 1514 suggest the influence of Italian chiaroscuro and were conceived in painterly terms, using a range of velvety tones rather than lines. His drawings include studies of hands, draperies, and costume, portraits, Madonnas, and intimate and detailed watercolor studies of nature. Despite the impressive scope of his workshop, Dürer left no direct successors, though his easily transportable prints were influential throughout Europe." .

It was only after his teacher's death that Dusart developed his own, more refined style.Dusart was born in Haarlem in 1660, the son of a church organist. In his late teens, he studied painting with Van Ostade, and his earliest works relied heavily on his teacher'scompositions. After Van Ostade's death in 1685, Dusart took over the contents of the studio and owned both Adriaen's works and those of Van Ostade's brother, Isack. Dusart reworked and sold many of their drawings, and in the process assimilated their styles and subjects. He also completed or adapted oil paintings by Jan Steen, whose style inspired him to develop figures with exaggerated expressions, gestures, and clothing.Dusart's depictions of peasants drinking and carousing were probably not intended as moral lessons about vice, but rather, served as a form of comedy. The satirical side of Dusart's art reflected popular theater, and his published prints had an impact on Dutchcaricature. By his death in 1704, Dusart had acquired a remarkable collection by the Italian and Dutch artists who most inspired him." .

He worked atCaereinEtruria, but he probably emigrated from Ionia. In Etruria, the Eagle Painter appears to have operated a workshop with one other artist and several Etruscan assistants. As with most vase-painters, the real name of the Eagle Painter is unknown, but he is named after his frequent depiction of this bird.In the mid-500s B.C. many Greeks fled from their cities on the coast ofAsia Minordue to Persian military activity in the area. The style of the Eagle Painter's work was heavily influenced by the vase-painting of these East Greek cities, but enough differences exist that scholars doubt he was apprenticed to any Eastern workshop. It is unclear where he actually learned his craft." .

Primarily a painter and sculptor, Eakins did not make photographs for exhibition. He made private portraits of family and friends, scientific documents, and used his photographs as teaching tools for his art classes and his work in other media.\"Should men make only the statues of men to be looked at by men, while the statues of women should be made by women to be looked at by women only? Should the he-painters draw the horses and bulls, and the she-painters...the mares and cows?\"So Eakins defended his predilection for the nude studies in non-formal settings that make up the bulk of his photographic work. The use of these photographs in the classroom eventually led to Eakins's dismissal as Director of Instruction at the PennsylvaniaAcademyof Fine Arts in 1886. Interestingly enough, his paintings and sculpture rarely included nude figures, and his desire to evoke a realisticclassicismwas more successfully achieved in his photographs." .

In 1844 Easterly sailed from New York City to New Orleans, where he made photographs before returning to Vermont the following year. He did not remain for long: by October, he had entered into a daguerreotype studio partnership in Iowa. He and his partner operated as traveling photographers working throughout Iowa and Missouri for several years. Some scholars have credited Easterly with making the first photographs of Plains Indians.After the dissolution of the partnership, Easterly moved to Saint Louis and took over a studio in 1848. He had a successful career for ten years, but his loyalty to the daguerreotype process after the introduction of theambrotype, tintype, and paper photograph processes caused his business to falter. By 1860 Easterly had begun to sell farm implements in addition to continuing his daguerreotype practice." .

The son of a goldsmith, Van den Eeckhout probably studied with Rembrandt in the latter half of the 1630s. The compositional principles of Rembrandt's teacher Pieter Lastman, known for his theatrical realism and illusionism, also strongly affected him. Rembrandt may have encouraged Van den Eeckhout to study Lastman's technique, for Rembrandt owned a number of his master's works.Van den Eeckhout adapted his style according to the genre in which he was working. Throughout his career, hishistory paintingsreflected Rembrandt's style in their broad execution,chiaroscuroeffects, and narrative qualities. His detailedgenre scenes, which he began depicting in the 1650s, anticipate works by Pieter de Hooch. Like so many of his Dutch contemporaries, Van den Eeckhout's portraits reflect the impact of Flemish prototypes and are painted in a more elegant, lighter style than his history paintings. Van den Eeckhout frequently included portraits in historical scenes, a genre calledportraits-histoirés. Van den Eeckhout's late history paintings most closely align him with Rembrandt's art through his use of chiaroscuro and color." .

He too began his training as a gardener in Paris but transferred to architecture with the permission ofElectorMaximilian II Emanuel, then living in exile in France. Effner's studies under the famous French architect Germain Boffrand fundamentally influenced his style; when he returned to Munich with the Elector in 1715, he brought with him the latest developments in French taste.As chief court architect, controlling all the architectural projects at court, Effner altered and extended the Elector's residences in the Munich area. His most important work was  the Nymphenburg palace. Not only did he enlarge the palace itself, but he also added three pavilions in the park: an octagonal Chinese pagoda, a ruined hermit's cell, and a tiled bathhouse. His designs for furniture, although influenced by contemporary Frenchébénistessuch as André-Charles Boulle and Charles Cressent, are lively and originalcompositions. He was eventually replaced as architect by François de Cuvilliés; Effner then became director of the gardens." .

In his work, Eggleston photographs \"democratically\"--literally photographing the world around him. His large-format prints monumentalize everyday subjects, everything is equally important; every detail deserves attention.A native Southerner raised on a cotton plantation in the Mississippi Delta, Eggleston has created a singular portrait of his native South since the late 1960s. After discovering photography in the early 1960s, he abandoned a traditional education and instead learned from photographically illustrated books by Walker Evans, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and Robert Frank. Although he began his career making black-and-white images, he soon abandoned them to experiment with color technology to record experiences in more sensual and accurate terms at a time when color photography was largely confined to commercial advertising. In 1976 with the support of John Szarkowski, the influential photography historian, critic, and curator, Eggleston mounted \"Color Photographs\" a now famous exhibition of his work at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.William Eggleston's Guide, in which Szarkowski called Eggleston's photographs \"perfect,\" accompanied this groundbreaking one-person show that established his reputation as a pioneer of color photography. His subjects were mundane, everyday, often trivial, so that the real subject was seen to be color itself. These images helped establish Eggleston as one of the first non-commercial photographers working in color and inspired a new generation of photographers, as well as filmmakers.Eggleston has published his work extensively. He continues to live and work in Memphis, and travels considerably for photographic projects." .

In his paintings he created fantasticRenaissancepalaces and churches that reflect his interest in the stage, for his designs often evoke theatrical sets and use dramatic light effects. Van Ehrenberg also depicted private collectors' art galleries. In 1662 he is recorded as belonging to theGuildofSaint Lukein Antwerp, the city where he remained for the rest of his life. Most of van Ehrenberg's pictures were painted between 1660 and 1670, and they were usually collaborations; other artists added the figures or animals. Drawings illustrating a journey he made to Italy also survive." .

Though he settled in Toledo, Spain, the artist known as \"The Greek\" signed paintings with his Greek name, Domenikos Theotokopoulos, and was forever influenced by his birthplace. Crete was a center for the Byzantine artistic tradition, concerned more with abstraction and pattern than with recording natural appearances. From 1568 to 1577, El Greco lived in Venice and Rome, where Titian's broad brushwork and bright colors, Tintoretto's sweeping movement, and Michelangelo's monumental figures reshaped his Byzantine heritage without replacing it.According to tales, when Pope Pius proposed covering Michelangelo'sLast Judgmentnudes, El Greco alienated many by offering to paint another mural, equally good, if they demolished Michelangelo's. He soon left for Spain. Failing to win favor at the Madrid court, he settled in Toledo, Spain's cultural and religious center. There he developed his trademark style-elongated figures, ecstatically free brushwork, expressive lighting, and acid color-a manner so personal that his assistants never attempted to follow his example.Acclaimed for his penetrating portraits, El Greco also received ecclesiastical commissions throughout Spain, including designing altarpieces. His paintings of Toledo are among Europe's first pure landscapes." .

Early in his career as a foreign missionary, he mastered typography and presented the people of Tahiti with their first printed book--theBible. The Polynesians were impressed by the printed word, and Ellis believed that the power of a visual image would be even more monumental. He studied photography specifically to impress the people of Madagascar, an island off the southeast coast of Africa that had long resisted Christian influence. Throughout the 1850s and 1860s, he made numerous portraits of the Malagasy that reflect his genuine interest in the people he served spiritually.Born to a poor family, Ellis was trained as a gardener, but deep religious feelings prompted him to enlist as a foreign missionary. Ordained in 1815, he first traveled to South Africa, then to the South Sea Islands. He was very successful as a missionary, combining spiritual earnestness with scientific and historic research. He rose up through the ranks of the London Missionary Society to become its chief foreign secretary and published a number of books based on his research and experiences." .

After settling in Rome around 1600, Elsheimer replaced theseManneristelements with simplicity. There he learned a new feeling for sculptural values and expressing mood through light and shadow from Caravaggio. Elsheimer painted in a miniature-like technique, mostly on small copper plates, yet he handled both pen and brush with amazing freedom. Above all, he invented a new type of landscape: rather than simplybackground, his gentle world enveloped figures with mysterious light and romantic charm. His intimate, deeply poetic visions immediately found admirers. He attracted artists from throughout Europe and was vastly influential in both Italy and the Netherlands. Unfortunately, Elsheimer had a \"natural inclination for melancholy,\" according to biographer. After making a bad partnership with a rich, vain Dutch etcher, he became overwhelmed and unable to work. The etcher had the unproductive Elsheimer thrown into debtors' prison, which led to his death." .

Often described as a difficult zealot, he vocally championed anaturalisticapproach to imagemaking. He favored rural subjects presented in a simple, direct manner. Emerson's influential 1889 bookNaturalistic Photography for Students of the Artoutlined his thesis that photography's ability to record nature truthfully was its most expressive one. He argued that the photograph should imitate nature rather than alter it.Emerson was a passionate lecturer and writer about photography, never mincing words and thus earning as many foes as supporters. He was an early and tireless champion of photography as a fine art, and he became the unofficial godfather of thePhoto-Secessionistmovement, founded by Alfred Stieglitz in 1902." .

His large, prolific workshop trained many leading painters, including his son Pieter Cornelisz. Kunst and Lucas van Leyden, whose workshop surpassed Engebrechtsz.'s around 1520. Engebrechtsz.'s acclaim may have attracted students from outside Leiden. When they brought to Leiden theManneriststyle then popular in Antwerp, Engebrechtsz. incorporated selected elements into his own art.Little is known of Engebrechtsz.'s training, and few of his early works survive. As Leiden's preeminent painter, Engebrechtsz. earned commissions from the town council and other important institutions, though he painted mainly biblical subjects. Judging by the inheritance quarrels, Engebrechtsz. had amassed a large estate by his death.Exaggerated emotionalism and monumentalcompositionspopulated by small, slender figures in pronouncedcontrappostoposes characterized Engebrechtsz.'s mature Mannerist style. He favored warm colors and enameled glazes applied in many layers to create glistening surfaces. His few independent portraits were rooted in close observation of the sitters' distinctive features and their setting." .

His signature is known from over thirty surviving pieces, and many other works are attributed to him on the basis of style. Ennion created the ground-breaking technique of blowing glass vessels into molds. This new process allowed the vessel and its decoration to be created at the same time and permitted the creation of multiple copies of the same vessel. Ennion's clear, precise designs distinguish his work; he also minimized the visibility of the lines caused by the seams in the mold.The location of Ennion's workshop is debated, in part because his work is found throughout theRoman Empire. Some scholars believe he worked in Sidon in modern Lebanon, while others assert that he worked in northern Italy. The inscriptions he frequently used as decoration may provide a clue. Though his name may have been Semitic in origin, he signed it in Greek, the language of the eastern Mediterranean, not Italy. The city of Sidon, where he may have worked, had all the raw material for glass-making and extensive trade connections." .

He worked in red-figure in the early days of the technique, but he also produced several bilingual cups with red-figure decoration on the exterior and black-figure on the interior, a type that was popular in this period. Epiktetos specialized in the decoration of cups, but he produced a range of other shapes as well. Scholars have attributed over a hundred surviving vases to him. He signed his name to almost half of these, often misspelling the accompanying verb. Throughout his long career, Epiktetos worked for several different potters, including Hischylos and the workshop of Nikosthenes and Pamphaios. Epiktetos produced delicate, precise work as a painter, and preferred scenes of daily life and Dionysiac revelry to mythological scenes.The name Epiktetos translates as \"newly acquired.\" Epiktetos was probably a slave, or at least he was when he began his career. Many of the artists working in Athens at this period would have been slaves or metics, the ancient Greek term for \"resident aliens.\"" .

Epimenes worked in the period around 500 B.C. in the Cyclades, carving both scarabs and scaraboids. His work is distinctive: his gems are decorated with nude youths with the musculature clearly defined and naturalistically rendered. Epimenes was also noted for depicting complex poses; on two gems, the youths appear in a twisting, three-quarter back view. He adopted this and other features from innovations occurring in sculpture and vase-painting of the time. His gems in the Getty Museum present figures in a three-quarter front view, something done less skillfully by other gem carvers.

He observes complex situations, with a sense of irony but also empathy toward his subjects. Epstein's projects have ranged from post-war Vietnam to his family's business and its relationship to the town he grew up in, to American habits of energy consumption. Epstein is also a cinematographer and production designer, with credits that includeSalaam Bombay!andMississippi Masala.In the early 1970s, Epstein attended several colleges: Union College, New York, Rhode Island School of Design, Providence; and The Cooper Union, New York, where he studied with photographer Garry Winogrand. By the mid-1970s, he began to travel, embarking on a photographic trip across the United States, as well as trips to Europe, the Caribbean, Japan, and Southeast Asia. In 1978, he journeyed to India producing the book,In Pursuit of Indianine years later. Six trips to Vietnam from 1992 to 95 are reflected in Epstein's publication,In Vietnam: A Book of Changes,whichreveals the complexity of a culture molded by French colonialism, the American war, and western consumer culture.The Cityis a reflection on Epstein's adopted hometown, New York City.Family Business(2000-2003), on the other hand, records the demise of his father's two businesses-a retail furniture store and a rental real estate empire-in his original hometown of Holyoke, Massachusetts. Epstein's latest effort--AmericanPower--concerns energy production in the United States, a country that consumes a disproportionate amount of the world's natural resources." .

A student of the great vase-painter Douris, the Euaion Painter continued the master's workshop into the next generation. The Euaion Painter was one of the principal cup producers of his time, but he also decorated other small vessels. In his favored scenes of athletes and revelers, he drew tall, thin, small-headed figures arranged on the vase with little overlapping.As with most ancient artists, the real name of the Euaion Painter is unknown. He is identified only by the stylistic traits of his work. Scholars named him after a kalos inscription on a cup in the Museé duLouvrepraising the beauty of the youth Euaion. Euaion was the son of Aeschylus, the greatest of the Athenian playwrights, and he seems to have been a favorite among the artists of the potters' quarter because several other painters also named him. Other sources identify Euaion as atragikos, a term that can be used either for a tragic playwright or actor." .

He signed his name on eighteen vases, six times as painter and twelve times as potter. To judge by their drawing style, the vases that he signed as potter seem to be later than those he signed as painter.In his early career Euphronios was one of a group of Athenian vase-painters who have been named the Pioneers by scholars today. Working about 520 to 500 B.C., they were the first to exploit the possibilities of drawing in the new red-figure technique. Like his colleagues, Euphronios was interested in showing the human body in a variety of poses, and he used overlapping andforeshorteningto give his scenes a sense of depth. On their vases, the Pioneers often depicted one another and even exchanged playful insults about each other. Later in his career, Euphronios's signature as potter appeared alongside the names of several of the finest vase-painters of this period, including Douris, Makron, and Onesimos. The precise details surrounding Euphronios's later role as potter are unclear. Perhaps as he got older and his eyesight failed, he switched to the more tactile, less visual craft of potting a vase. Or the potter signature may mean that Euphronios actually owned the workshop, a sign of his prosperity and success in the industry." .

Although Cesar spent most of his life in his native Alkmaar, The Netherlands, scholars associate him with the Haarlem school of painting. The Haarlem school painters created idealized,classicizinghistory paintingsandgenrein the mid-1600s. Everdingen's paintings similarly emphasized draftsmanship, but the sensuality and prominence of his figures distinguishes his pictures from others of the Haarlem school." .

His studies were funded by Philippe-Laurent de Joubert,financier, art collector, and father of Laurent-Nicolas de Joubert, whose portrait by Fabre hangs in the Getty Museum. In 1787 Fabre became David's second pupil to win thePrix de Rome. Upheavals in revolutionary France and Fabre's monarchist sympathies kept him in Italy for much of his life. Moving to Florence in 1793, Fabre foundpatronsin Italian aristocrats and tourists who appreciated the elegance,realism, and precision of his portraits. As a member of the Florentine academy and an art teacher, art collector, and art dealer, Fabre was prominent in Florentine society. Changing fashions, lack of patrons' interest, and gout caused him to abandonhistory paintingfor portraiture, landscape, and printmaking, though he remained a lifelong devotee of David'sNeoclassicism. In 1824 his companion, the countess of Albany, died and left Fabre her fortune. Returning to France, Fabre increasingly dedicated himself to his hometown of Montpellier, founding an art school and curating his donations of books, paintings, drawings, and artworks. The Musée Fabre was inaugurated on hisfeast dayin 1828." .

Although scholars have some information about his career, little is known about his life, not even how he lost his eye. Perhaps originally from Florence, Fanelli worked in Genoa producing bronze religious sculpture before moving to England. In 1635 he received a pension from Charles I and described himself as \"Sculptor to the King of Great Britain,\" a title that may have been conferred upon him. Fanelli worked in ivory as well as metal but was appreciated in England because his bronze casting was far superior to that available in Northern Europe at the time. For his royalpatron, Fanelli created large-scale bronze sculptures on religious and mythological themes. Several copies and versions of these statues survive, suggesting that Fanelli used his molds to make reproductions. Working in aBaroquestyle, Fanelli had a particular knack for portraiture.

But he preferred to exhibit at theSalonrather than with the Impressionists and unlike Claude Monet or Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Fantin-Latour rarely painted outdoors.At the age of ten, Fantin-Latour began training as an artist with his father, a painter. He later studied with Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran, an innovative and important teacher known for his system of teaching visual memory. Fantin-Latour developed an enthusiasm for Italian painters, especially Titian and Paolo Veronese, and regularly copied their work at theLouvre. It was at the Louvre that Fantin-Latour met Édouard Manet with whom he forged a friendship; he would later paint Manet on several occasions.By the early 1860s, Fantin-Latour was producing the three genres of painting that would sustain his career: portraiture, still-life painting, and imaginative or mythological scenes. Commissioned portraits and still-life paintings of flowers and fruit were essential to the artist's livelihood and he established an important clientele in England. But Fantin-Latour received the greatest critical attention for a series of ambitious group portraits featuring many of the most renowned artists, writers, and musicians of the time. His imaginative works were often inspired by his great love of music and he created several paintings based on the operas of Richard Wagner. Fantin-Latour increasingly exploredlithographyas a testing ground for his fantastical works." .

His master's eccentric manner encouraged Farinati to emphasize line over color and to restrict hispaletteto grays, browns, mauve, and rust. Farinati worked mostly in his native Verona, but a 1552 painting commission for the MantuaCathedralaltered his approach. In Mantua, Farinati studied Giulio Romano's complex, energeticfrescoesand soon adopted his animated figure types and elaborate, imaginary architecture. He also adopted Paolo Veronese'schiaroscuroand less polished brushwork, and Michelangelo's muscularity, which he had studied in reproductions.Farinati kept a detailed journal from 1573 until his death. In it, he outlined his wide range of projects: painting frames; designing costumes; decorating headboards, doors, horse trappings, and missal covers; and prestigious commissions foraltarpiecesand frescoes in churches and villas. His chiaroscuro drawings on tinted paper are particularly notable; he often used them to plan his paintings, and more than five hundred survive. Very soon after his death, they became collector's items; Sir Peter Lely, an artist and renowned collector in the 1600s, owned many." .

Lux Feininger was born in Berlin and spent his early years in Germany. He studied art at the Bauhaus School in Berlin under, among others, László Moholy Nagy and Oskar Schlemmer, yet he was unable to study photography there because it was not taught until 1929. Feininger learned it nevertheless, and in 1927 he went to work for the Berlin photo agency DEPHOT. Two years later he participated in the groundbreakingFilm und Foto Stuttgart 1929exhibition.Feininger began to paint in the early 1930s; after three years of living in Paris, he relocated to New York in 1937, leaving behind the majority of his negatives, which he never recovered. He did not make photographs again until after World War II and then only for his own use and enjoyment. After 1953 Feininger stopped making photographs altogether. He turned his full energies to painting and teaching, first in New York and later in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He retired from teaching in 1975, but he continues to paint and exhibit his work." .

Although he seems to have been fairly prolific, analtarpiecepainted for the town of Ranverso in 1531 is his only documented work. Scholars have also attributed a larger group of unsigned paintings to him. Ferrari's style exhibits the highly refined qualities of lateGothicart, a style that persisted in northwest Italy into the 1500s." .

A prolific artist who spent his life on vast decorative projects, Ferretti studied in Imola and Florence, then spent five years in Bologna. There he absorbed that city's well-known style of studying and drawing from nature. Returning to Florence in 1715, Ferretti soon joined the Accademia del Disegno, where he later taught painting and served asConsole,a post he retained almost until his death. From about 1728, he designed tapestries for the grand duke of Tuscany's tapestry workshop. He began incorporating elements of Venetian artist Sebastiano Ricci's airy manner, which had inspired Florentine artists since Ricci's 1706 visit to the city.By the 1730s Ferretti was building a large workshop that gained fame in Florence and beyond. Outstanding for their complexity and monumentality, hisfrescoesin a Pistoia church transformed the solidity of his Bolognese-influenced style into a light and elegant manner via Ricci's art. He died while working on frescoes in a Florence church." .

After being educated in Paris, he returned to Brazil, where he began to photograph the urban landscape of Rio de Janeiro in the 1860s. He established his own studio in 1865 specializing in landscape photography. Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil, himself an amateur photographer and one of the wealthiest men in the 1800s, gave Ferrez money to photograph, which allowed him to flourish artistically.Eight years after Ferrez established a studio in Rio de Janeiro, a fire destroyed it. He traveled to France, purchased a new camera, and upon his return to Brazil began to focus on rural landscapes and images of slaves working on plantations. He joined an expedition of the Brazilian Geological Commission and became a master of the panoramic photograph, using a camera capable of taking a 180-degree view. He reestablished a studio, taught photography, and operated a photographic supply house.Throughout the 1870s and 1880s, Ferrez exhibited his photographs in the United States and Europe. In the latter decade he began to photograph architecture and street scenes and in 1907 opened the Pathé Cinema in Rio de Janeiro." .

The Ferrucci family specialized in the rare field of hardstone carving and was known for its ability to work withporphyry, a material almost as hard as diamond. The flourishingMedicifamily, whose fondness for porphyry stemmed from its ancient association withHellenisticroyalty, was the Ferrucis' most importantpatrons.Ferrucci Del Tadda worked in the Medici family's Galleria dei Lavori, a grand ducal workshop in which local craftsman trained in thecommessotechnique. Here he producedpietre dureportraits of KingHenry IVandPope Clement VIIIin commemoration of the king's marriage to Marie de' Medici. He also executed a portrait ofCosimo I de' Medici, probably meant to decorate the prince's chapel. One contemporary writer thought these portraits in stone were morenaturalisticthan painting because the colors were not mixed; the artist had to use color just as it had been formed by nature. Ferrucci Del Tadda is best known for his animal sculptures for the Boboli Gardens in Florence." .

Fetti was greatly influenced by Peter Paul Rubens, whose transparent red and blue flesh tones he adopted, German expatriate landscapist Adam Elsheimer, and those followers of Caravaggio who explored Venice's rich color. Fetti became Mantua'scourt painterin 1613. There he studied Giulio Romano's work as well as Rubens's and became increasingly influenced by Venetian painters, particularly Titian and Tintoretto. Fetti painted largefrescoesthere, but he was best on a small scale. A fine portraitist, hispalettewas warm, light, and rich. He created an effect of vibrating light by using complementary colors and rapid brushstrokes heavy with paint. Fetti left Mantua hurriedly in 1622 and settled in Venice, a city he had first visited in 1621 in order to buy art for hispatronand employer, the duke of Mantua. Despite the duke's efforts, he refused to return to Mantua. In Venice Fetti devoted himself to small easel pictures, many illustrating the Parables and set in homely surroundings or landscapes. They were probably popular, for he repeated them often. Fetti soon became ill and died in 1623." .

Despite holding an important position within hisguild, his fortune was modest, and his workshop contained only three clocks when he retired. His work was highly regarded by his contemporaries, as Fiéffé's clock movements were usually installed in cases of very high quality, made by well-known craftsmen. He used the titleClockmaker of the [Paris] Observatory,which probably meant that he was responsible for maintaining that building's clocks. Fiéffé retired early, after the death of his wife in 1758. He was succeeded by five sons, four of whom became master clockmakers like their father." .

As with most Greek vase-painters, the artists are not known by name but are distinguished only by their stylistic traits. The Fighting Rams Group takes its name from a scene on an aryballos now in the Berlin Museum. The group worked in the city of Corinth from about 670 to 630 B.C. They decorated small vessels with bands of animal and floral decoration. Although their vases are not so elaborate as many painted by other contemporary artists, these simple vases represent a trend in Corinthian vase-painting in the mid-600s B.C. On its aryballoi, the Fighting Rams Group favored compositions of animals facing one another as if about to fight, hence the name of this workshop." .

The manuscript, now located in a library in Paris, was once owned byJean, duc de Berry, the most famous book collector of his time. Since many of the manuscripts containing the First Master's work, including theHistorical Bible,appear to have been produced in Paris, the artist probably worked there during the first decade of the 1400s.

Mastering the newly invented technique ofscagliola,which imitated hardstone inlay, Fistulator headed a talented family of plasterers, stucco artists, and scagliola workers. Their production, continuing well into the 1600s, influenced artists throughout Germany, Austria, and the Alpine regions. Fistulator, who looked to architectural treatises for inspiration for hisreliefs, became known for creatingillusionisticperspectives of classic Italian architecture as well as of buildings recalling those of the celebratedRenaissancearchitect Bramante. Employed primarily by the Bavarian courts, Fistulator created illusionistic reliefs for theMunich Residenz, or palace. His scagliola panel in the Antiquarium of the Munich Residenz, a grandsalonbuilt to house the ducal collection ofantiquestatuary, is a tour de force of vanishingperspectiveand imitation marble. He also created reliefs for the church of Saint Michael's and began panels for the Reiche Kappelle (State Church) of the Residenz, though they were not completed until 1630 or 1632 by his son Wilhelm." .

Eight years later, after participating in numerous local and Midwest exhibitions as an amateur, he entered a national competition, expecting to receive only an illustrated catalogue of the prize-winning images. Instead, to his surprise, he won the first-place prize of 150 dollars instead. \n\nShortly thereafter Fleckenstein and a colleague organized the Salon Club of America, which was devoted to the nationwide promotion of the various regional Pictorialist photographers' clubs. By the time he moved from Montana to Los Angeles, where he opened a portrait studio in 1907, he had exhibited at the Royal Photographic Society in London and become an internationally known photographer. In 1914 Fleckenstein, along with a young Edward Weston and others, formed the Camera Pictorialists of Los Angeles.

She had begun as an amateur at age nine after receiving a camera as a much longed-for Christmas gift. A portrait photographer for more than fifty years, Fleishmann's sitters included the sixteen-year-old actress Hedy Lamarr, conductor Arturo Toscanini, and architect Adolf Loos. Her Vienna studio became a gathering place for artists and intellectuals. She regarded herself not as an artist, but as a photographer.Before leaving Austria in the 1930s, Fleischmann inexplicably destroyed all but forty-one of her negatives. She settled in New York, where she resumed her portrait photography, working occasionally forVoguemagazine. Among her more famous subjects were writer Sinclair Lewis and physicist Albert Einstein." .

There Flinck met Jacob Backer, who deeply influenced the young artist's early style.In 1633, armed with practical and technical skills, Flinck moved to Amsterdam, studying with Rembrandt van Rijn until 1636. He became so absorbed in Rembrandt's approach that some of Flinck's paintings from the 1630s have been confused with those of Rembrandt.Like many other Dutch painters during the 1640s and 1650s, Flinck began making his portraits more elegant and brightening his palette under the spell of Flemish artists such as Anthony van Dyck. After imbuing an allegorical painting for Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, with the then-fashionable Baroque ideas of pathos and pomp, Amsterdam's citizens thronged to him for portraits. The new style also brought strong demand for allegorical scenes for palaces and public buildings. Flinck received important commissions for Huis ten Bosch, a royal residence, and the new Amsterdam town hall. In 1659 he was commissioned with twelve large paintings for the city's great civic hall, but he died soon after signing the contract." .

He returned home in 1676 with the characteristic Baroque,painterlystyle he kept for life. Foggini'sreliefsoften display contrasting diagonals and skies with mythological or Christian figures amid clouds and shafts of light. Drapery is characterized by a rippling pattern, which Foggini contrasts with smoothly modeled, highly polished areas of naked flesh.After Fernando Tacca's death in 1687, Foggini was appointed grand ducal sculptor and within the decade became the court architect as well. His position with the Medici was all-powerful and secure. In addition tobustsof Florentine luminaries and the Medici, Foggini's major works include reliefs made for various chapels in Florence. His many pupils prolonged his style well past the middle of the eighteenth century, until the advent ofNeoclassicism." .

Although only accepted into theguildas a master in 1789, the year the revolution began, Folin had been active as a clockmaker for many years before. Guild records label him as aTrinitaire,a term applied to students working on the grounds of the Hôpital de la Trinité in Paris. Free of charge, the hospital taught children a craft for eight years, the same length as a normal guild apprenticeship. At the end of this period, young craftsmen had the right to be received into the guild as a master with no other formalities such as creating a masterpiece.Folin's business prospered during and after the Revolution, whenNapoleonI ruled France. He was even able to buy two properties for over 22,000livresduring the worst days of the Terror." .

For much of his career, he worked for the French court, sending furniture to the palaces ofVersailles, Compiègne, andFontainebleau. This earned him the title ofmenuisier du Garde-Meuble du Roi(Furniture-Maker to the King's Household). In one year alone, he delivered 60 beds, 50 screens, 4 settees, 135 armchairs, 468 chairs, 21 benches, and 84 stools, for the sum of 18,200livres.Guildrecords reveal that four out of the five employees in Foliot's small workshop went on strike in 1749. At the court inquiry, Foliot's wife complained that he had \"obtained an important order from customers whom she could not name, and [he] felt that the workmen were obliged to return to work.\" The order may have been from either royalty or the nobility, as Foliot's private clients included Madame Louise-Elisabeth, Duchess of Parma. Despite labor difficulties, Foliot earned enough money to purchase two houses in Paris and a house in the country, where he kept an excellent wine cellar. His widow continued his business after his death in 1776." .

When he moved to Urbino from his native Castel Durante, he took the Fontana family name. Along with his father, the master potter Guido Durantino, and his brothers Camillo and Nicola, Orazio helped to shift the dominant area formaiolicaproduction and innovation from Faenza to Urbino and nearby Castel Durante by introducingistoriatodecoration there.Orazio worked with his father for most of his career; he left in 1565 to set up his own workshop nearby. From that time on, he concentrated mainly on luxury wares decorated withistoriatoscenes andgrotesques, leaving the plainer, and probably more profitable, white and common wares to his father. After establishing his own workshop, Orazio may have continued to paint ceramics or may have managed the shop's production." .

Active in Milan, his membership in theAccademia della Val di Bleniobrought him commissions frompatronsof high rank and Milanese intellectuals who appreciated his portraitmedallionsandrock crystalengravings. These show a sophisticated use of space as Fontana accommodated large, activecompositionsto small, low-relief objects in metal, rock crystal, and hardstone.After a visit to Rome, where he probably studied works by Michelangelo and his followers, Fontana traveled to Palermo in 1570. There he carved large-scale marblereliefsfor thecathedral. Upon his return to Milan, Fontana began working on the church ofSanta Maria presso Santo Celso,the sole source of any of his surviving large-scale sculptural works. Fontana worked there from 1574 to 1587, carving marble statues and reliefs for the façade and statues for the altars. He may even have cast some liturgical objects in silver and bronze. Having transformed his style from his earlyMannerismto a more severeclassicism, Fontana died in Milan at the age of forty-seven." .

Early in his training, Fontebasso studied Tiepolo's frescoes and eventually came in contact with the venerated artist. Settling in Venice, Fontebasso increasingly emulated Tiepolo in his palette and compositional designs.By the 1740s, Fontebasso had established himself as a leading artist in Venice. Mainly active as a decorator of churches and palaces, Fontebasso worked both infrescoand on canvas. Like Tiepolo, Fontebasso also produced pen-and-wash drawings and executed numerous book illustrations. In 1761, Fontebasso visited Saint Petersburg and produced ceiling paintings and decorations for the Winter Palace. Sadly, like several other of his major decorative projects, this work was eventually destroyed. Fontebasso returned to Venice in 1768 and was elected president of the Académie Royale. He died the following year." .

Although not much is known about his early years there, he was working in a photographic business in Sacramento by May of 1852. At the end of that year, he moved to San Francisco, where he opened a gallery on Christmas Day. At the height of his career, Ford was one of the most successfuldaguerreotypistsof the Gold Rush era.Ford opened another studio in Sacramento in 1854. Due to ill health, he sold both galleries that same year, although he continued as a daguerreotypist in San Francisco. Ford tried once again in 1856, opening a gallery in San Jose without success.

The author of this biography, which was written almost a century after Forte's death, failed to recognize and appreciate the artist's innovative approach. Modern scholars credit Forte as the first painter to compose still-lifes with landscape backgrounds, replacing the plain, dark grounds typical of the early 1600s in Italy. His use of light, shade and color to accurately render objects such as grapes and pomegranates has also received considerable praise. \n\nAlthough Forte's career is almost entirely undocumented, one surviving letter to an important collector reveals that he was successful during his own time. Forte charged 200 ducats--an impressive sum of money--for a still-life of various fruits." .

Although he studied law and mathematics and became a lawyer in the Parlement de Paris, science was his real interest. Fortier published several treatises, the first on thermometers and barometers and another on the movements of the earth, based on the theories of Copernicus. These scientific pursuits led him to build both orrery clocks and planispheres. His scientific instruments were collected by the foremost scientists of his day, including Bonnier de la Moisson, who put one of Fortier's instruments in the chamber devoted to mechanical objects, at the center of a series of rooms devoted to scientific and natural curiosities." .

He worked as an independentébénisteuntil he was almost forty years old, when he finally registered with hisguildas a masterébéniste.The inventory taken in 1775 after his death shows that his workshop was still in full production at the end of his life: there were six work benches equipped with tools, as well as a large stock of clock cases. The inventory also notes several cases made entirely of bronze. As strict guild regulations forbadeébénistesfrom working in bronze, it seems that Foullet was selling merchandise outside his trade.Foullet produced works almost exclusively in theRococostyle, although his inventory mentions works \"à la Grec\" (in Greek taste), a term that would apply to the design of the Getty Museum's clock, a fine example of this earlyNeoclassicalstyle." .

As with most vase-painters, his real name is unknown, and he is identified only by the stylistic traits of his work. He received the nameFoundry Painterbecause one of his vases, now in Berlin, shows a foundry in which bronze workers are making statues.The Foundry Painter probably learned his craft in the workshop of the Brygos Painter and at some point in his career he worked with Onesimos. He also collaborated with at least two potters, Brygos and Euphronios. Greek vase-painters often specialized in the decoration of certain shapes of vases. The Foundry Painter specialized in cups. As for his style, the Foundry Painter represented figures in a less idealized, more realistic manner than many of his contemporaries." .

When he became a Dominicanmonkaround 1417, Giovanni da Fiesole was already a working artist. His style earned him the nickname \"angelic,\" and theDominican ordergave him the standard honorariumFra(brother). At the time of his death, Fra Angelico was one of Italy's most famous painters. He made only religious works, and it is said he never took up his brushes without first saying a prayer. Nothing is known of his training.When Masaccio died in 1428, Fra Angelico was one of few painters who understood his innovations innaturalism,narrativepower, andvanishing pointperspective. Fra Angelico practiced Masaccio's ideas such as using realistic light to create solid, heroic forms. Fra Angelico'sDescent from the Cross,painted around 1434, is one of the first successful Italian attempts to set a group of figuresintoa harmoniously receding landscape. Around 1443 Fra Angelico and his assistants created fiftyfrescoesfor their newmonasteryof San Marco in Florence, now a museum of his work. His simple and clean style, served to instruct or encourage contemplation. He died in Rome while painting for the pope." .

The purity of lines and volumes in one of his paintings inspired the young Raphael.A mule driver's son, the young artist born as Baccio della Porta studied with a local painter, then worked with Ghirlandaio's conservative workshop. In 1498, when he saw Florence's convent of San Marco stormed and its strict, charismatic prior Savonarola dragged to prison, Baccio vowed to become amonk; he became Fra Bartolommeo in 1500. Seeing no distinction between life and art, he allegedly burned his non-religious works and depictions of nudes, considering them sinful. In 1504, like Fra Angelico years before him, Fra Bartolommeo ran the San Marcomonasteryworkshop. He incorporated Leonardo da Vinci's smooth harmonies, spiritual feeling, andsfumatointo his work. To stress the gulf between the divine and the earthly, Bartolommeo was among the first artists to replace contemporary costume with nondescript drapery. By 1508 he was the foremost artist of the Florentine school. Eager to stay abreast of his contemporaries artistic advances, he visited Venice that year and Rome around 1514. Bartolommeo's influence spread through his lively drawings, but the San Marco workshop closed soon after his death." .

His father, a minor painter, provided his early training.By 1513 Fra Paolino lived in Florence at the convent of San Marco, where he made two clay statues. He likely assisted Fra Bartolommeo and probably also worked under his sometime collaborator. Fra Paolino's first documented painting, aCrucifixionfrescofrom 1516, combines compositional elements taken from both these teachers.Fra Paolino adopted Fra Bartolommeo's sereneclassicism. When he received Fra Bartolommeo's drawings after his death in 1517, Fra Paolino used them as models. His own drawings show his elder's influence, but they demonstrate a greater spontaneity than his paintings. He passed these drawings to his pupil, anun, after his own death.In the late 1520s Fra Paolino settled in Pistoia, where he paintedaltarpiecesthat disseminated his style throughout Tuscany's provincial towns." .

At a time when Sienese artists were little known outside their native city, he worked at courts in Urbino, Naples, and Milan, where he met Leonardo da Vinci.Francesco probably trained with painter and sculptor Vecchietta; his earliest dated works are manuscriptilluminations. Mournful eyes, a halting linear flow in drapery and hair, delicately awkward posing of necks and hands, and classically inspired architecture characterize his style.More sophisticated than his paintings, Francesco's sculpture shows acquaintance with earlier Florentine masters such as Donatello and Lorenzo Ghiberti, along with his contemporary Antonio del Pollaiuolo.By the 1480s Francesco was among Italy's leading architects. Working in Urbino for Federigo da Montefeltro by 1477, Francesco served as a diplomat, sculpted bronzereliefs, built 136 military fortresses, and probably completed the ducal palace.Francesco authored the first important Western writings on military engineering, works keenly studied by Leonardo and others." .

His spacious architectural settings and the swaying movement of his figures reflect his two trips to Rome, where he studied Raphael's murals.The workshop that Franciabigio founded with Andrea del Sarto around 1506 shaped multitudes of young Florentine artists. Del Sarto's art of velvety grace came to overshadow Franciabigio's less polished style, despite its dramatic force and sincerity, and the two friends became competitors. When the friars of a church unveiled both their murals the same morning, not realizing that Franciabigio's was unfinished, the artist \"almost died of grief.\" Giorgio Vasari reported that he tore into the wall \"with a bricklayer's hammer.\" Franciabigio's damagedMarriage of the Virgin,still on view, testifies mutely to his rage.Franciabigio's introspective portraits captured his sitters' spirit and mood along with their physical appearance. In an early series of half-length male portraits, each man posed with a gaze fixed either meditatively or piercingly on the viewer." .

He probably served an apprenticeship in his father's studio and trained with his uncle in Paris. In 1605 he became a master in the AntwerpGuildofSaint Luke.Francken createdaltarpiecesand painted furniture panels, but he was most renowned for his small, finely crafted cabinet pictures of historical, mythological, orallegoricalthemes. Francken introduced new subject matter to Flemish art, often with a moralizing message. His luxurious imaginary art galleries influenced Jan Brueghel the Elder and Peter Paul Rubens, and his \"monkeys' kitchens,\" allegorical scenes of monkeys enacting human vices, remained popular into the next generation of Flemish painters.Francken's skill lay in small figures; his best paintings were usually collaborations with architecture or landscape specialists. Over time, his moralizing gave way to a stronger emphasis ongenreelements, and his paint application evolved from a thickimpastoto thin glazes and freer brushwork. His studio was enormously prolific. The records of the art dealer for whom he worked show replicas and copies for sale as well as originals; these copies were probably made by Francken's own sons, sons-in-law, and other apprentices." .
